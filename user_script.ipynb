I have never left this restaurant hungry, the quality and the portions go hand in hand with what you are paying for. The appetizers such as one-off orders of nigiri or tako-wasa are as equally amazing.The only thing preventing me from giving Kaisen Don 5 stars is due to their lack of staffing. I usually try to come at off-hours given their turn rate with tables is slower than other SF restaurants. There has definitely been times where I have dined here and it's taken a significant amount of time to order or get the bill.Great food, but could use some additional staff.\",\n",

I would never think of splurging in a sushi restaurant I haven't been to, let alone before consulting yelp.I'll get straight to the point.Food? Ewwww! Edible but nothing much to email home about!Fish Quality? Would you believe both entrees we ordered didn't come with fish except unagiAmbiance? Meh! Almost bare bones, tiny and sat like 20 without a sushi bar.Authenticity? Nah!Price? More on the Ouch side! Service? Sweet and pleasantAnything else that might be worthy of Praise?Nary a word.....Hold it! Kaisen Don boasts of 10 variations of chirashi.Lunch started with a cup of miso. Skip! Oops! I forgot it was complimentary. Bland, blah.....Chirashi lured my wife into Kaisen Don. \\xa0She can be a cheapskate at times. It was a valiant effort on the part of the owners to open up shop with chirashi and donburi as their mainstays. They have nigiris on specials on the board. I didn't trust the quality or the prices or their knife skills. Chinese restaurants are a dime a dozen whereas sushi is an extremely difficult craft to master that requires years of apprenticeship under a good sushi shokunin (master). Wifey loves chirashi and Kaisen Don boasts of 10 different versions of chirashi. Trust her to pick one that had no fish. Well, not exactly as there was a piece of salmon skin roll in her chirashi! WTF? She picked the namesake chirashi (Kaisen Don), the one-of- a-kind chirashi with no fish but 4 pcs of puny scallops, ikura, crab leg and sushi omelette ($20.99) (2/5)I haven't had unagi in a while and thought Unagi Don ($17.99) may be satisfying as a light lunch treat. Besides, I wanted something sweet, robust with a rich lushness in flavor as I was fighting off a long cold and cough that might have thick coated my tongue. My gripe was the rice, as it didn't taste like any of the premium Japanese rice. It definitely lacked the sticky texture of Japanese rice like it was picked up from Costco or Amazon! In fact, the rice was a tad dry and hard. In addition, I guess it also wasn't that great an idea to use last night's leftovers for today's lunch! (2/5)I am a retired sushi snob and I don't pooh pooh sushi crafted by non-Japanese anymore as long as the fish is of decent freshness and quality and the rice were fluffy and flavorful. Today, I wasn't able to verify either. May not come back provided someone is paying.\",\n",

It was a rice bowl with 4 slices of scallop, lump crab meat, and ikura. I can taste the quality. The scallop was so sweet and tender. But the portion was small. I'm a gal that has a pretty hefty appetite, and I really could've eaten two dons. My bowl was ~$20, which is affordable for a sashimi don, but I think they can give a little more food at the price.My friend ordered a couple of rolls and wanted to do the Yelp check in for 15% of rolls deal. The waitress said that the check-in deal is only for Tuesdays. I've never heard of check-in on a certain day only, so they might want to make it a lot more clear. Or better yet, don't make it a check-in deal.Service is great. Maybe too great? The servers come by quite often to top off waters/teas and ask about the meal.\",\n",

I ordered the takoyaki balls, uni, ingleside roll, hamchi avocado roll, rock n' roll and the rainbow don. None of the food I ordered was amazing. It all tasted okay. I would skip on the takoyaki; it was a big soggy and soft and had no crunch or flavor to it. Felt like I was eating mush. The only fish I really enjoyed was the uni. Super fresh and creamy. The service here is great. The staff is super attentive and came by multiple times to check in on us. When the platter of sushi was delivered, one of the uni pieces fell off onto the table and the staff quickly remade the uni piece for us. They also came by to report the hot sake for us. I really appreciate the good service. The restaurant itself is pretty small inside. Make reservations in advance. On Tuesdays they offer 10% off sushi rolls. Parking in the area wasn't too difficult. Was able to find a spot right across the street. Also right by the muni train stop.\",\n",

The specials are a bit pricey, but the rolls on the regular menu are decently priced (compared to other sushi places in the city). The quality of the sushi rolls were good, and I wouldn't mind coming here if I was in the area or for take out.The place is pretty small and only fits several small tables, but luckily I didn't have to wait when I came here on a Friday night.

I came here for a spontaneous late lunch on a sunny Sunday afternoon. \\xa0It's a tiny restaurant maybe not more that 15 people can fit here. You can make reservations or sign your name on clipboard to wait your turn I believe it's well worth it. By luck only one table was waiting for me by the windows.I chose the hot unagi bowl which was great flavor an presentation. Excellent! I give it 5 stars! Yummy in my tummy. The unagi was soft, silky and smooth. The whole world disappeared with just me and \\xa0the cooked eel and nothing else mattered, until the K train roared by and brought me back to reality! LOL My meal came with a light mild soup filled with carrots, potatoes in tiny squares and seaweed. I splurged and ordered Takoyaki which is batter cooked octopus served with spicy mayo. It came with 6 balls with a mini octopus arm inside the soft filling. Interesting. I like how the heat makes the flakes move. Nice effect which I took a video. Definitely the main course for me stood out. \\xa0I want come back and splurge on the Chirashi bowls to see how the raw stuff tastes like because I think was what most people ordered at each table. If you know you coming here ahead of time with some friends hopefully less than four make reservations. Again very tiny local place, a hole in the wall I would say.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'We found Kaisen DON on Yelp and were so glad we did. We booked a table - key because this place is tiny. We almost missed it after our driver dropped us off. The place is spotless with a nice modern atmosphere. We love Nigiri and were happy to see a huge selection of fish, including three kinds of toro, ocean trout, salmon and yellowtail belly and two kinds of mackerel. Jackpot! We also had a few handrolls - all were fresh and delicious with perfect, crisp nori. We also had two different kinds of sake, including the oldest brand, Kenbishi. Both were served in the box, so you get the straight up flavor as well as the slightly different flavor of the wood box. Delicious! Great selection of fish and sake as well as lots of Japanese beers in the bottle. We thought the prices were good for Bay Area fresh fish - especially for the quality. Our server was really great as well. We would definitely come back!',\n",

       "  'review': 'I first heard about Kaisen DON through food bloggers on Instagram. I had this place saved on my phone since April and finally got to check it out last Tuesday with some friends. On Monday night, we checked this place on Yelp and saw that there was a Groupon offer. It was a pretty good deal and since the restrictions only said the coupon was valid for \"one per person\", we assumed that we could all use one since we were paying separately. However, this is not the case. **It should be one per table/party.** Make sure to read the fine print as well since there are restrictions on certain (more expensive) food items like the omakase don, toro, uni, etc. Another thing to keep in mind is that although we visited during their Tuesday rolls special (20% off), this offer (same goes for Oysters on Wednesdays) could not be combined with the Groupon offer...which was a bummer. We decided to use one of our Groupons instead since it was more worth it. As for the service, the server was kind and attentive. The food was alright; it wasn\\'t mind-blowing/super fresh as some have mentioned, but still decent nonetheless. The place is quite small, but we came towards closing time (before break time; around 1-2pm), so there weren\\'t a lot of people there. Overall, it was kind of upsetting that the deals could not be combined and should\\'ve been stated clearly beforehand, but it\\'s still a decent sushi and sashimi place with hardworking owners. My friends will most likely be back (haha) since they still have their groupon deals to use before December.',\n",

The restaurant is really small so I try to make a reservation before I go. Since it's so small, it can also be really loud and I'd say it's more of a casual spot than a date spot. Everything I've tried was pretty good. One thing I didn't really like was the chicken karaage. The texture / batter wasn't that great. I like the miso soup they serve here. It has diced daikon and carrots in it and actually tastes freshly made in house as opposed to packaged miso soup served at other casual sushi places. It's something really basic but it's one of my favorite parts of coming here.\",\n",

December is slow month for restaurants and that's prob why they need to use Groupon or similar channel to get more biz.

The servers come by frequently to check on you and refill your water, but as it is very busy, it's not somewhere I'd stay and chat with a friend over a slow meal- quick turnaround to get other customers in to eat.

The scallops crudo with truffles and microgreens was soo orgasmic, like woah! We came as a group and to our delight, it was their 20% off all sushi rolls Tuesday night. Wednesday is $1 oysters just FYI.I'm impressed with their miso soup - it's truly one of the best that I've ever had and I'm really particular about this rather basic staple. There are carrots and daikon in the miso soup and it just tastes so healthy and fulfilling. We ordered a collection of small plates from a secret menu and everything was fresh and artfully plated. I minus one star because they don't have their alcohol license (yet) and our group was a little disappointed that we couldn't order drinks. Service was a tad on the slow side but I would definitely come back and give this another go!\",\n",

I came here with my family of 3 for lunch on a weekend, there's only a couple of tables (relatively a small restaurant) we were given an option to sit three at a smaller table or wait for a bigger table. We decided to just sit at the smaller table because we weren't sure how long the wait will be. We ordered two rainbow dons $18-18 (3 pieces of salmon, 3 pieces of tuna, 3 albacore) and a chasu don ($13) as well as a lion king roll to share $9. We originally wanted the hamachi Kama but the waitress told me there's only a limited amount available per day. We came around 12:30PM and their lunch time closes at 2. The rainbow dons were delicious and super filling, quality of the fish was very good. The Chasu don was okay- but I feel like most people would come here for the raw fish so I didn't expect it to be amazing. The lion king roll was a bit on the smaller side but for $9 the price does reflect for their good quality fish. I'll definitely come back again I think this place for people who want a high quality sushi fix yet don't want to spend a huge amount of money.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Cute spot to grab sushi. Fresh fish, moderately priced. Wednesday had $1 oysters so we had to try them. They tasted fresh, and the dressings on top complimented the oysters really well. The hot sauce tasted a bit like sriracha but it didn't overpower the flavor of the oyster. We also tried the dragon roll which had really crispy tempura. The eel was bomb and there was a good amount of sauce used.I ordered the Rainbow Don and it was delicious. The fish tasted really fresh and the portion size was pretty fair. There were 9 large pieces of sashimi total and I was very full after. My friend got the Curry Beef and the portion was huge! The curry was tasty and not too salty.I liked the wooden table and warm interior of the restaruant. The servers were attentive and refilled water without asking. The pricing is pretty standard to me for sushi in the city, the quality of the fish here is good and I'd come again for a good meal.\",\n",

Chirashi bowls will set you back about $18 for the regular one and the Deluxe one is closer to $30. My friends enjoyed their meals. I got two rolls: tuna and avocado and spicy tuna. Both were $6-7 each and they were good but small. Next time I would probably opt for one of the bowls or the special rolls. All in all, the sushi is fresh and good and decently priced for sushi. The staff are really nice but it's definitely a super tiny spot and parking can be a hit or miss in this area.\",\n",

They serve a lot of don bowls like salmon, chirashi, rainbow, eel, etc. all really fresh and good size portions. Prices are good too. Each bowl ~16. It's a very small place. Just about 10 tables. I came on a Sunday and waited about 15 minutes for dinner. Parking is street so it can be hard as well. Tried the salmon and rainbow don. Both very good. Flavorful and not too fishy. Also had a lion king roll which was good as well. One of the better ones I've had. Not too saucy. A meal for two with the deal ended up paying around $30 which is a steal!\",\n",

Anyway, first thing to do is check in on yelp for free edamame.So the fish is so fresh it melts in your mouth, pair some don and hand rolls and you got yourself a solid meal. You can splurge a little if you want and get their omakase; either way, you're getting some really fresh food here. Did I mention that you should be ordering sashimi here? The portions are well managed so you're not gonna feel stuffed but you will feel satisfied. It's a small space here and the prices might be a bit up there, but you're paying for good quality food here. It's surprisingly not too crowded here so eat here before it gets way too popular.\",\n",

Pricing of the charashi bowls are on the higher end. However, with a Groupon, the pricing is a lot more reasonable. My friends and I ended up waiting about an hr for the the only two large tables to become available and we were starving! We were even there waiting close to the dinner opening time but we weren't able to snag the tables first. Thankfully the servers/cooks in the back were super quick and brought out our food shortly after we ordered. The sashimi in the rainbow don is fresh and delicious but the portion is small. I don't recommend ordering the Hawaii poki salad- also super small and it's only about four bites of salad. I would recommend this spot if you have a Groupon deal and if you're not coming with a big group of people!\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Finallly got to try this place after it's been in my yelp bookmarks for so long! I came with 2 friends on a weekday night around 6 pm. We were happy to see it wasn't crowded. We all ordered the 6 cube mini don after seeing pictures on Instagram! We also ordered the Kaisen spoons. The Kaisen spoons came out first, and they had oyster, uni, ikura, tobiko, and sauce in them. You're supposed to eat it in one slurp and ooooh they are so good! The 6 cube mini don came out after and it was just as pretty as we've seen on yelp/IG! I especially liked how they provided seaweed to wrap up the sushi + rice. All the fish was delicious--I can't even pick a favorite. My least fav fish was probably the shrimp because I normally don't eat shrimp nigiri. I even liked the ikura, which I usually don't because it's very salty. But at Kaisen Don, it was not as salty and even slightly sweet! My only gripe with Kaisen Don is that we saw on the menu that happy hour (15% off bill) was from 5-7pm. We ordered the spoons at 6:15pm, expecting the 15% off. However when we paid the bill, we were charged like there was no percentage off. We asked the waitress and she let us know that we had to pay before 7pm... definitely not something we thought. We all just looked at each other awkwardly lol. So if you're trying to get 15% off during happy hour, remember to pay before the happy hour is actually over.\",\n",

When we walked in, it was pretty empty. But that meant our service was excellent! Took me a while to write this review so I'm unsure of the prices.FOOD:Kaisen bento (4/5) comes with salmon, tuna, scallop, tamago, hamachi, uni, and ikura. I really loved how they presented this in a box, everything was really cute since the pieces were a bit smaller than other places.Kaisen spoon $7 each (5/5) Oyster ikura uni and tobiko with ponzu sauce. I find this pretty worth it since this does include uni and oyster and they were pretty fresh.\",\n",

Oh well.Between the two of us, we split 3 rolls, an appetizer, and each had a beverage. We had a late lunch and were simply curious at trying what they had.The rolls were nice. The simple rolls had fresh fish.The more intricate rolls had great texture, were nicely presented, and specifically unique.Appetizers were good.Overall, a good experience, especially since we found seating within minutes of dropping by.',\n",

Was kind of disappointed with the appetizers: Tako Sunemono and the Truffle scallops. I though it would be a good portion of Octopus and cucumbers in the salad, but had only two slices of tentacles and the truffle scallops were small portion wise. :( Very tasty, but won't get those again. I had the Chirashi Don. Not bad, but not spectacular. I will try something different next time.Service was good & the waitress was attentive...Overall, a nice place to get your sushi fix.

       "  'review': \"The FoodWhile searching for a Japanese restaurant in the area, found this Kaisen DON. I ordered the Salmon Ikura Don while my friend ordered the Rainbow Don. The Salmon Ikura Don came with king salmon, shrimp and salmon row. The Rainbow Don came with bluefin tuna, king salmon, and hamachi. Looking back, I should've ordered the Rainbow Don also. All the chirashi bowl comes with complimentary miso soup and seaweed on the side. All the fishes were pretty fresh, and it was delicious. They have something called the Six Division Mini Don that's limited 10 serving per dinner. I wanted to come back next time and try this. It has truffle salmon, negitoro, hamachi, salmon, cooked scallop and shrimp.The MiscellaneousThe restaurant is small in size with limited seating available. I did not go during peak hour, so not sure how long wait is during peak hour. The interior is simple with few decorations. The service was good, and the staff is also sincere. Though there were only a few staff working in the restaurant. They have a variety of selections on their menu besides the chirashi bowls. They also have appetizer, sashimi, hand roll, and tofu pocket, as well as specials. The prices are a bit high compared to other sushi places, but they have the quality. Should try out this place if you haven't, and I would like to return to try their other dishes.\",\n",

After I done and ready for check out, the waitress told me the voucher cannot use in Uni, Oyster, and some kind of Don what a hided message in the Groupon( you must read it very carefully)I bought so many vouchers from Groupon in different categories, this is the first time I met this issue.Food: I order one tray Uni 38$ They all in different qualities, some taste sweet, and most of them tastes bitter. 6 pieces kusshi Oyster 3.25$ eachOh god, if I know that's not 1$ each, I won't order. It already have sauce over the Oyster, and I still can taste it is not fresh at all. I would rather eat it in some where else and it is cheaper than here. Unagi hand roll 5.95$This one is average, not really impress. Total I paid 68.64$ and not include tips, I would definitely go have a Omakase in the bay than this restaurant. It totally doesn't worth any penny. So end up I did not use my voucher since I did not order enough values on it which is not worth to use it. On this point, I want all to have an attention over here if you purchased any voucher from Groupon cause you may can't use it on select items! Overall, I won't come back not just cause I can't use my voucher lol and also it is over price base on the food quality.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'DISCLAIMER: From my understanding, the GroupOn cannot be used for uni, oyster, and other dishes. The check-in\\u200b promo for 20% off rolls is only valid for lunch. ------I\\'m pretty mad at myself that I didn\\'t try this place sooner\\u200b when I live 5 blocks away!! Located in the bustling area of Ocean Ave, this restaurant offers high\\u200b-quality\\u200b fish for a reasonable price for the surrounding area. For parking, you will either find metered or nearby residential if you\\'re fine with walking a block or two. The streets are normally busy with other restaurants, 24 fitness, or CCSF. The restaurant is small and intimate\\u200b, so it\\'s great for groups of 4 or smaller. I found the service to be okay. Waiters/waitress refilled our teas normally and answered our questions, but when I brought up inari (tofu looking skin w/ rice inside), the waiter seemed very confused about what I was inquiring about - even after I showed him. I guess they no longer serve it here and he must\\'ve started working here after March. It also seems that their menu changes periodically. When I came in initially, it was packed - no tables open. I saw a couple getting ready to leave, so I signed my name on. As I\\'m waiting by the door, a lady comes by and shoves me walking in to sign her name on the clipboard. As I watched the waitress clean up the table, I was about to head there and seat myself but stopped because I felt that I should wait for them to come to me. When the waitress had finished and started to walk towards me, I started to walk towards her assuming I was going to be seated immediately. The waitress then stops me because she thinks the woman who pushed me came first (but she saw me first?). She checks the clipboard and reads off my name then finally seats me. There\\'s a sign with their specials including the 1/3 tray of grade A uni. Underneath the sign is a piece of paper in small print that says \"Please wait to be seated,\" along with other words that I did not see. I think they need a bigger sign that mentions the clipboard and to please wait to be seated.Aside from that, the service was prompt for the most part. We ordered one of the rolls (don\\'t remember the name), mini-don (off menu), and 1/3 tray of grade A uni. The roll was not memorable because it came with 6 TINY rolls, I felt like I could hardly taste the fish. The mini-don ($28) feels like it\\'s an omakase dish as it\\'s a surprise. It contained ebi shrimp, octopus, seaweed salad, toro, salmon and much more. The fish was\\u200b fresh and high-quality for a reasonable price. I wasn\\'t feeling super hungry but it surprisingly filled me up. My bf got the 1/3 tray of grade A uni ($39.95). When we asked how many pieces it comes with, the waitress said it doesn\\'t come in quantity but the weight of it. The dish is served on a tray of ice with a side of wasabi & seaweed wraps. My bf said the dish was definitely fresh and good, but not worth the price. He says the dish is better shared than eaten alone.We also had planned to order $1 oysters (Wednesdays), but we came at closing and they ran out. We both agreed that the restaurant offered high-quality fish for a reasonable price. We\\'d definitely come back to get our sushi fix!',\n",

       "  'review': \"I had heard so much about Kaisen DON and was so excited to try it! I was meeting up with friends and we decided to eat here on a whim. We got here right when it opened. They informed us that they didn't have any blue Fin tuna at all today so they would be replacing the bowls with tuna with other fish. The menu is quite extensive in terms of the bowls they have and they have a rotating menu of appetizers and specials! I opted for the truffle salmon don and it had 6 pieces of seared salmon topped with truffle sauce. It also came with cucumbers , tamago and some seaweed on the side. The rice was nicely seasoned and when you wrapped the rice, seaweed and salmon together it was delicious! We also tried the salmon ochazuke and it was ok. The salmon was a bit salty but it was still decent. Probably wouldn't be something I order again but I would come back for all the other bowls.This place is def not on the cheap side, but if you like good quality fish this place is a good option. Can't wait to come back to try the other dons.Total for 3: $95\",\n",

Omakase Don: the bowl have 12 pc of fresh sashimi and sushi rice/ comes with seaweed and wasabi/soy sauce.Truffle with Scallops: 4 pcs of scallops topped with tobiko and truffleOverall, the sashimi was fresh but the cut can be more generous. The concept of this place is not bad since they are mainly serving the fresh fish/bowls or hot bowls such as unagi don, salmon ochazuke don, gyu don and etc. If you like chirashi- I recommend coming here! For price wise, I do think this is an average price for chirashi bowls but I wish they would give the option to substitute some fish.',\n",

       "  'review': \"I finally made the trip here after seeing a bunch of IG posts and one of my good foodie friends raved about their truffle salmon don. I kept my expectations low since I've heard this place served small portions and high prices for their quality. Upon arriving, there were so many workers just standing together. The place was really small and practically empty, with just one other table. We had the omakase don, truffle salmon don, edamame and they gave us miso soup. The Omakase don has a variety of raw fishes. However each piece lacked quality. The tuna had a bad texture, the salmon was very translucent and tasted old, the uni was the fishest uni I've ever had in my life and everything else was meh. The truffle salmon don was just okay. Six pieces of warm truffle salmon on top of a huge bed of not-the-best sushi rice was a let down. The miso soup they brought us was pretty bland and needed more flavor. I thought it was strange they chopped up a carrot into the soup. Maybe to make it look fresh? It's probably from powder. Bf went home feeling sick to the bones. Literally 20 minutes after we left, he started sweating and needed to use the rest room ASAP! He spent the remainder of the night in bed feeling really sick. For a $60 meal, we expected more. We definitely won't be back.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I recently went to Kaisen Don on Ocean Ave for lunch. They specialize in Chirashi Bowls. \\xa0There are 10 Don bowls yet only one vegan option- Very Green Don- Seaweed, tofu, cucumber, & sweet tofu all over sushi rice. This is what I ordered since I am a longtime vegan of 19 years (will get my pension in veganism soon). Kaisen Don is a Rice Bowl which some different Sashimi are placed on Sushi Rice. Normally, it\\'s served at Sushi restaurants & is popular for lunch. Chirashi, also called chirashizushi (ちらし寿司) is an interesting Japanese meal. The word \"chirashi\" means \"scattered,\" so this is basically a big bowl of rice mixed with fish, vegetables, & additional ingredients of your choice. Glad they had at least one vegan option. It reminded me of unwrapped sushi in a bowl.The Very Green Chirashi Don bowl also had pickled ginger & wasabi like is typically accompanied w/ sushi. I found it quite alright yet would love them to have at least one other vegan option such as avocado perhaps or even a more innovative vegan option.The Very Green Don also came w/ a complimentary miso soup w/ wakame sea vegetables. I had this w/ a side of edamame-seasoned soy beans. Although was an interesting experience that I am glad I had would be more likely to return if they had some more interesting vegan options as aforementioned.',\n",

She should be contacting Groupon and not be bitching about the policy changes that Kaisen Don implemented for 15-20 minutes.

I really wanted to try it b/c it was all over Instagram for a while, but when I went I don't really think it has anything over other sushi places. It's a super small space on Ocean Ave, maybe enough capacity for 15-20 people. I went on a Monday so there was no wait, but I can definitely see it being difficult to get a table on a weekend. There's quite a few different styles of bowls, ranging from around $15-$30 depending on what you get. I get that raw fish isn't exactly cheap, but the prices still seem a bit steep. It didn't help that the waiter seemed like he was always trying to upsell us on random stuff: we (party of 5) went on a Monday to get the $1 oyster special. Originally we wanted to order 10, so two per person, but the waiter said we could only order 6 or 12 even though it doesn't say anywhere on their menu that you can only order in increments like that. We also each ordered an unagi taco and he tried to convince us to order more of different types so we could try them all. No thank you... On the plus side though, the bowls are absolutely beautiful!\",\n",

I loved their baked scallop roll. Mango salmon and avo hamachi was pretty good as well. However I ordered Uni nigiri and (I think) it was $18 for 2 pieces and it wasn't fresh. Very sad.. because I've seen my friend order trays here and they always looked really good. Maybe IG filters do make everything look better? I would, hands down, return for dinner but just maybe skip the Uni.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"TL:DR- don't buy their Groupon, lots of hidden rules and they enforce the party limit. Feels misleading. Read through reviews and some other people feel the same way. Food was good but I cant support this restaurant anymore because of their Groupon policy.I'm going to be the person who reviews this establishment on their Groupon policy and not really their food. So sorry in advanced for being THAT person but I typically read the policies in advanced so not alot of fine details don't surprise me. I try my best to understand their prospective but I don't like the inconsistencies at this establishment.I came here before with a friend of mine, we both got the Groupon for 1 thinking it's ok to both use one for our own bowls. We got there and while we were about to pay, they said one Groupon for the table (fine that's fair, wasn't happy because they didn't exactly say limit on groupon per table on the fine print but I get It)UNFORTUNATELY, I bought another Groupon their 80 dollars for 4 people. So I waited to last minute to use the group, was about to expire,(my fault) went and got a table with my hot date then showed them my Groupon to the server and asked if I can use it. They said yes, then started to rifle off BUT you can't use it on this this and this, which I don't see anything on the Groupon (such as the sashimi and the more expensive charashis) but sure whatever. Then we look at menu and as we're about to order, they say, since you're a table of 4 you can't use this Groupon. Which is why I'm creating this review. \\xa0I'm not sure if I've ever encountered a restaurant that was that strict with their rules regarding party size not meeting quota and if you're that strict, it would be nice to explain on the Groupon that you must meet minimum party size. And obviously if they are going to be that strict, why even let us use the one. I tried their food before and it was pretty good so that's why two stars. Fish was fresh and the rice had good consistency. Got the rainbow Don I think. It's a shame this happened because I wanted to come back to try their oysters but oh well, there are other restaurants that have oysters.\",\n",

So yesterday I went and ordered the same dishes. When I got my check and told the waiter I had a Groupon he told me that he can't accept due to some new policies. I was shocked considering it only has been a couple of months since I've last been there. He basically said that the $80 can only be used for 4 people. Does that freakin matter?! I'm still spending that amount between the two of us! In addition, he also said that it does not include sashimi. Excuse me, but it does not state in my Groupon. How is that reasonable?! In the end, I paid, but gave a horrible tip and reached out to Groupon to trade in for Groupon bucks. So screw them. They just lost a customer.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Saw this place online and decided to make the drive from South Bay to try it.Walked in on a Sunday night. Restaurant was about half full. Server greeted us immediately and we chose to sit at the window slotted seat in the front.While the menu is small, I feel like it covers a wide range of options being a chirashi bowl restaurant.Service was on par all night. Our server explained all the specials and options on the menu to us and made sure our tea was never empty.Now on to the food, delicious!!!Scallop burger: while small, remember this is literally a scallop sandwiching uni and truffle. The truffle was so good, but not too overpowering. I was able to taste the freshness of the scallop and the richness of the truffle. I got the creaminess of the uni but the taste was kinda lost in between.Foie gras hand roll: SOOO good. This was my favorite. Seared foie gras making a creamy texture sandwiched with sushi rice and seaweed. Luscious!Volcano don: spicy, but flavors were all there. The tuna was definitely fresh and you can taste the cattiness of the fish throughout. Loved that they paired the seaweed with itRainbow don: fresh fish, tasty sushi rice, a delight!I loved how all the fish and rice was room temperature. I hate biting into super cold fish when eating a don or super hot rice cooking the fish.Checkout was a breeze as they did square pay at the table too.Definitely worth the drive up! Would recommend!',\n",

       "  'review': \"Service: Normally I don't care about service as long as the food is good. However, I found it difficult to even get someone to look in my general direction. They have 5 staff for 10 tables, and somehow manage to neglect both the tables and the line outside. They also don't respect the list in their seating priority. Not to mention their check in offer for 20% off is not even an offer. It is only valid on Tuesday and it's their regular Tuesday deal. Deceptive way to get more check-ins. Also their daily special is definitely not daily, as it doesn't line up with their week day specials. They probably never update it, to give off the facade that the fish is fresh and seasonal. Food:Miso soup:Is watered down, sprinkled with undercooked vegetables.Kanpyo roll:The seaweed is overly tough from excess moisture, usually indicated by old or premade rolls. Vegetable roll:Disproportionately too much rice, but at least the little vegetables you taste are quite nice. Just very diluted from the mountain of rice. I think most of the flavor comes from the packaged picked daikon in the roll. Rainbow Don:One of their bowls had a nicely seared piece of fish, that was disappointingly backed with otherwise unimpressive fish quality. The rice was alright, better than the rice in the rolls. Oysters:Wednesday $1 oyster happy hour. They tasted quite off, with an overwhelming fishy flavor beyond that of any other oyster I've eaten. I hope these aren't the same oysters they serve on other nights. They're probably the ones they didn't sell from the nights before. Final thoughts:I'm not sure why there's a line to this place. It doesn't do much better than your average unimposing local sushi place, but this one costs maybe 50% more, and will slow down your meal by more than that out of sheer inefficiency. The very same inefficiency that allowed me to write such a lengthy review.\",\n",

I have never tried the blue tail fish, but it was fresh and nice. The basic concept of the place I believe is like finger food and you can make your own hand roll.

Maybe some people don't like it but I don't mind about a restaurant has a menu has less variety. It brings to the point that higher expectations on food when the menu is limited. The price point that we paid for didn't match up the quality that we got. Not sure if we will go back again, unless the quality is going to change.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"The SO and I are absolute sushi lovers and were disappointed with our experience. The service was alright-- it was sometimes difficult to flag down a waiter/waitress as the two people working that night were chatting by the registers. We started with a scallop burger and blue fin sashimi. The uni in the scallop burger had a funky flavor that completely overpowered the scallops and the blue fin was very fishy and not melt-in-your-mouth tender. My main was the rainbow don and the SO got the omakase don. Both of our dons tasted very fishy and overall we felt that the fish was not very fresh. There was a decent fish to rice proportion but I ended up eating a lot of the rice to cover up the fishy flavor. I'm hoping that my one experience was just an off day and I'd like to try it out again in the future... but it's just a bit on the pricier end for sushi.\",\n",

This time rice was sour and hard, the miso soup was bland, and the tea wasn't even hot. I don't mind paying for tea but the least you can do is make sure it's hot. The salmon was pretty good, but the hamachi and maguro was nothing special and not worth the price. We also ordered a few rolls to try (rock and roll, spicy salmon, spicy tuna) as well as the salmon ochazuke which also came with cold tea.I believe they've changed owners a little while back and the quality of the food and fish has gone down since. Definitely not worth the price they're charging and won't be coming back.\",\n",

       "  'review': '3.75/5Saw all the colorful and enticing photos online and absolutely had to give this place a shot. Came on a weekday right around noon and the place was almost completely empty. Parking was street only but not too bad just a few blocks away (where there\\'s no time limit either). Service was very friendly and helpful. The place is small but there\\'s seating for a few small groups though they seem to be good about doing takeout as well since I saw a lot of people coming in to get takeout orders.For my meal I got the following:1) Foie Gras Taco: A fatty strip of foie gras about 1/2 an inch wide and the length of a small handroll. The foie gras was buttery and had a nice sear but the whole thing was just dripping oil to an unexpected extent. Like puddles of it. Not sure if it\\'s all from the foie gras or from something else? Flavor-wise the slightly sweet sauce was nice. I think the biggest issue was the quality of the nori which needed to be crisper but it was chewy and ruined the melting experience of the foie gras.2) Omakase Don: The bowl is so colorful and amazing to look at I almost didn\\'t want to eat it. The bowl wasn\\'t huge but not deceivingly small either (unlike other similar fancy dons I\\'ve had) with each slice of fish being thin but still sizeable. My bowl included uni, ikura, chutoro, tamago, scallop w/ their \"truffle\" sauce, hamachi, japanese scallop, foie gras, and salmon w/ pickled wasabi all served with a pad of wasabi with their logo which was very cute. Rice quality was average. Good texture but lacked flavor. Tamago had an appropriate amount of sweetness but nothing great, just what you\\'d find at a typical sushi spot. Fish quality was decent for the price. Not the freshest and on the softer side, but still retained some flavor. I loved that they did do small things to enhance the flavors like adding the \"truffle\" sauce, pickled wasabi, or some chili flakes. Also wasn\\'t a huge fan of the ikura\\'s marinade which I found salty and one-toned. Overall, a decent bowl for the price though.Overall, I enjoyed my meal here. It\\'s honestly a bit more eye candy than mouth candy but if you\\'re looking for pricier cuts of fish at a reasonable price, this place is a great solution. Would definitely love to come back.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Yeah, I know, I haven\\'t reviewed in a while. But tbh, I kind of enjoyed not having to write something every time I decided to eat out. Too tedious \\xa0for one thing. And for the most part, I have been eating at places that I like and go to often, therefore, I have already reviewed them early on, and told you that I liked them. So what is there left to repeat? Still good? Nah, just eat and enjoy, alone or while socializing with others, without having to go to the phone, and \"tap tap, click click\". Until now. Suddenly, because my experience here, \\xa0invoked old feelings, like when I used to review, I had the urge to review this place. And I\\'m happy, because that\\'s the way it should be. Write when you feel YOU HAVE TO, not just because you\\'re there. So, here goes Kaisen Don. First, I must say,, I don\\'t understand what place most reviewers are writing about when I read the reviews for this place. My wife and I (which are probably older than most that come here, and review, and can \"see through\" everything pretty clearly,) certainly didn\\'t see anything here, (except the polite service, hence the second star,) to warrant all the enthusiasm. The \"Rainbow Bowl\" that I ordered was at $21 way overpriced, and a mess of assorted fresh sliced fish, with a couple of other tiny indistinguishable (what they call) \"sides,\" on top of plain white rice. No masago (fish roe,) no seasonings, sauce or flavoring to make the \"don\" tasty. And although the fish was fresh, this is nothing that you can\\'t put together at home for $7. (Get some small sashimi \"blocks\" from Ranch 99, slice them and put them on top of your steamed rice, voila, same \"Rainbow Don\" as here.) in fact, all three sushi rolls we ordered were a bit below average, and immediately fell apart when we picked them up. The rice was not wrapped tightly enough and rice and ingredients fell all over the place. The youngsters in the kitchen need to learn some bamboo sushi roller skills. And they were way overpriced, compared to the same rolls in other places around here. But all that\\'s nothing, compared to my wife\\'s \"beef\"curry which is the real \"star\" of this review. Wow! Unbelievable! What came out was a plate with one clump of rice surrounded by a sea of (slightly watered down)curry sauce, (the boxed Japanese \"Golden Curry\" that you find in Asian supermarkets for $2.99 and that you make at home in 5 minutes,) devoid of ANY beef, or other ingredients. ( my wife said it looked like \"baby food.\") Seriously, no beef or anything else in the \"beef\" curry. Just tiny clumps of unmelted curry in the plain sea, a really amateur, \"home from middle school, I\\'m hungry, mom ain\\'t home yet, so let me make me some curry,\" type. And at $13.99! Wth? No thanks. So my summary? Looking around at the clientele, mostly 20 something group of single, tech type SF hipsters and wanna bees. Either they don\\'t know or don\\'t care that this is sub par, easier to make yourself (doubtful that they know or care to cook,) overpriced, mediocre food. Unfortunately this is the trend in SF\\'s \\xa0restaurants. \"Less is more\" mentality. Driven by the techie boom. Got plenty of much better (and cheaper) Japanese restaurants with much better and more food at much lower prices. There, got it off my chest. Now back to hibernating. Maybe.',\n",

       "  'review': \"Kaisen Don is the place to go when you want chirashi sushi bowls. The fish here is always fresh and the presentation is nice. I've been here twice now. Both times with a Groupon, which the servers were more than happy to help me with. They were also extremely attentive and came around with water multiple times and asked us how we were doing. Since the place is really small, they often have to rearrange the tables, but they seem to really know how to fit the most people into the tiny space that it is. On my first visit, I had the hamachi Don, which was $18.95. It came with 5 pieces of hamachi, a piece of tamagotchi (egg), a piece of a salmon skin roll and salmon roe over sushi rice. The fish was very fresh and didn't taste fishy at all and the rice was nicely seasoned. But not too seasoned if you know what I mean. It was a nice balance. I'd recommend this if you wanna stick to one type of fish. While it is a bit pricey, it's worth if it you want high quality fish.On my second visit, I decided to stick to sushi rolls since I felt like my hamachi don was just average the first time. I wanted to try a variety of fish, so I ordered the rainbow roll and the Ingleside roll. Both were very filling, tasty, and the fish was very fresh! The prices for these were pretty average too.Overall, I think I'd come back here if I was craving fresh sashimi and chirashi. The service here is great but I think the prices are a bit high. That's understandable though as it is located in San Francisco.\",\n",

I saw this place through one of my friend's Snapchat or Instagram and saw that they served tons of uni here!The lady and I came on a Saturday night and we got lucky and got the last table. The server was really nice and explained the menu to us as well as provided recommendations.Truffle Salmon Don: - Seared King Salmon with some truffle and tamago. Comes with some seaweed so you can make your own tacos out of it. Man this was so good. The salmon was top notch and super fresh. Truffle was a nice addition that added to the dish.Negitoro Don - Blue Fin Tuna Toro aka fatty tuna belly with Salmon Roe. Definitely my favorite dish of the night. They import everything fresh from Japan and negitoro is hard enough to find already. They give a ton of fish too!!Spicy Hamachi Taco: Tons of fish with some sushi rice and real wasabi in every bite. Uni Taco: Fresh uni and tons of it! For uni lovers, definitely try this or just get yourself the uni tray!!Super great and fresh food. Great service as well! Definitely would recommend!\",\n",

For a party of 4, we waited close to an hour, and we were only second or third on the waitlist. Goodness. So you might wanna reconsider going with large parties.Their menu is quite extensive I'd say, lots of options to choose from. Portion is very big and I had a hard time finishing my food. Sashimi was super fresh & delicious, we ended up ordering more on the side, maybe that's why I had a hard time finishing my food. Overall I'm super impressed. The price is very very reasonable for the portion and generosity in ingredients. The main dishes we ordered came out very inconsistently. Some was quick, some took forever to get on the table. Service was excellent though, and I think it helps that it's a very small place, haha.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Alright, to be fair when I first came here I wasn't so impressed. I came during their soft opening and gave them advice. Their sushi rice wasn't seasoned enough and it really led to a poor experience, the balance was not acidic enough nor sweet enough. The rice is the most important part of the dish because the freshness of the fish is a given. Though I warn, that consistency is hardest to achieve when mixing rice, one rookie mistake and one side of the rice will be over seasoned.I am happy to know when the last two times I came back their rice has improved and in combination with their roasted nori, it is really delicious. They really do sushi don well. I believe that it is more of that perfect balance of how the rice should taste. Fish, rice, fish, rice, the flavor of the rice should bring out the flavor of the fish and refreshes your palate, then stimulates your appetite. To be fair the quality of fish fluctuates (seasonal, global warming) so I cannot blame anyone for it. Ikura is tasty here and so are the appetizers. I do need to agree that, the tea and soup temperature needs to improve but these are easy fixes.The price is high and most people complain about it because they are intimidated by an all-in bowl price, but if you eat nigiri often - how much does an assortment of 8-10 nigiri pieces cost at a typical sushi restaurant? Of that size and quality? \\xa0Common, anyone that says it's expensive need to take your self down the street and get a 2 for 5, bigmac and qtr cheese down the street. Never take this dish to go, what are you doing? go get urself a sushi combo somewhere else. Chef to table, not Chef to bag, to the car, to Safeway, to pick up friend, home then Netflix and sushi don? Might as well make fried rice from it. I do recommend to order roasted nori every time you go, it is a real game changer and should be eaten that way all the time. Only 1$. Not worth giving fewer stars about, boohoo. \\xa0Really is a 5-star review, but they really need to up the game of their miso soup and hot tea, that's embarrassing. Is that really the first experience you want your guests to have by setting negative first impressions.\",\n",

I woudn't say there are that many Japanese restaurants that I constantly crave, but Kaisen Don has become one of them.Their known for their chirashi bowls and they come packed with fresh sashimi of all kinds. \\xa0They're creatively displayed and will definitely leave you full at the end of the day. The Omakase Don is a popular (but expensive choice), as well as their Kaisen Don. \\xa0Our party also tried a bit of their Mexican Uni. They were certainly fresh but \\xa0uni portions are small, as they are at more places. We thought about ordering the half-tray of uni, but that's definitely something you can expect to give up your wallet for and we settled for the smaller portions instead.Overall, Kaisen Don is a great place to get your chirashi and uni fix, but due to it's small space, I wouldn't bring anymore than 4 friends here.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'TLDR version: Food is amazing - fresh quality, very Instagrammable bowls, and great service!Now for the deets, because all of you are curious I\\'m sure!To be completely honest, the boyfriend and I have tried most of the menu so I\\'m just gonna list out my thoughts on each dish, per usual. Kaisen Spoon - I loved this one, it reminded me a lot of the hamachi shots from Alexander\\'s except with oyster and not hamachi. Would totally get this again. Foie Gras Taco - This was their take on a more modern hand roll. It\\'s so delicious, you get a fatty rich bit of liver with every bite. The rice helps cut down the fat so it is PERFECT. Scallop Burger - We love us some raw scallop (hotate) so we loved this. This was similar to a hand roll as well but a bit different. Definitely worth a try if you\\'re looking for something more unique. We also loved the truffle sauce in it!  Scallop Uni Don - Did I mention that we love raw scallop? LOL. This is my favorite bowl, actually it\\'s my \"usual order\" every time I head in. Because it combines 2 of my favorite things, delicious scallop and rich uni. They\\'re the perfect combo over rice. Yum! I can\\'t wait to get it again. Rainbow Don - Boyfriend got this one and loved it. He enjoys a bit of variety in his rice bowl so this definitely provided that. He had some salmon, hamachi, and tuna. We loved that the kept with their branding and even put their logo on their wasabi. Super cute touch. Their mochi ice cream was great as well. We loved the green tea flavor. Needless to say we can\\'t wait to be back!',\n",

The salmon was sooo yummy- cooked and flavored just enough without overlooking when the green tea was poured over the dish. I loved it. My boyfriend got the Kaiden Don and my friends got the Salmon Ikura and Rainbow Don. Everything came with miso soup which was just as yummy as well. Also got the free edamame for checking in on yelp! Overall it was a super nice meal. Wish it was closer to the city but I'm glad we ventured out to eat here. Everything was fresh.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"New restaurant opening excitement gets the best of some of us. I'm one of the biggest offenders but I'm glad I waited on Kaisen Don.Kaisen Don soft opened about 3 months ago in the former Rainbow T Dessert space. It's a small restaurant with seating for about 20 people so it's not a place to come rolling in with your entire posse of 10. It's ideal for solo diners and couples. No reservations. \\xa0 Kaisen Don's specialty is chirashi with about 10 variations. For those squeamish about raw fish, they have dons with cooked proteins: chicken teriyaki, unagi, chashu, and beef curry. Each order comes with a complimentary bowl of miso soup. Currently, they don't have a liquor license. If you see a particular item on their Yelp page that you want, call before visiting. I saw a pic of the shaved ankimo but they didn't have it and the girl at the table in back of me wanted negitoro but they didn't have that either. Note to the owner, there's a small discrepancy on your Yelp page. It says, to mention Yelp to get 20% off but the grand opening check-in offer is 10% off. Last week, I had some time to kill because of street cleaning in my area so I figured it was the perfect time to visit Kaisen Don.I ordered the Omakase Don ($28.95): bit.ly/2H8jKfF. The fish and seafood toppings will vary daily and based on seasonality. On the day, I visited my Omakase don was topped with Mirugai (geoduck), Hamachi (yellowtail), Ikura (salmon roe), Uni (sea urchin), Hotate (scallop), Sake (salmon torched), Amaebi (raw shrimp, no head), Kani w/ its brain (crab leg w/ torched brain), and Tamago (sweet egg omelet). For the value driven folks, the cuts of fish (~12 slices) are thicker than usual for a chirashi. Small sheets of nori are provided so you can make mini hand rolls. (+) Good variety with some premium offerings like mirugai and uni. Remember I said, I was glad I waited on visiting Kaisen Don? During their soft opening, the toppings for the omakase don were run-of-the-mill fish like maguro, hamachi, and sake. Didn't see premium offerings. (+) Everything was super fresh with my favorite being the perfectly sweet and briny Santa Barbara uni. So good. (-) Knife skills could be improved. Several slices didn't have clean edges (i.e. amaebi). (-) While the sushi rice was a good temperature and texture, it was underseasoned and plain. (-) The wasabi was awful quality (dry, crumbly texture). Yes, it has their cute embossed fish logo but I hope the owner looks into using higher quality wasabi to match their fish. \\xa0Service was polite and friendly. I was their first customer of the day and it took about 20 minutes for my order. Minimalist dining area with wooden tables and metal chairs. I enjoyed the 80s and 90s music they were playing. Looking at their pictures and their reviews for the past couple of months, it does seem Kaisen Don has some consistency issues and/or still trying to figure things out but I wouldn't be opposed to returning. Their raw fish is good quality and that's what's most important to me.When I'm having a raw craving and don't want to spend $$$ on a nice sushi dinner or deal with the madness at Amami, Kaisen Don will do just fine.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I\\'m super hesitant to write this because I feel like people still don\\'t know about how great this place is but... review I must. First & foremost, Kaisen Don is super tiny. I would say it only seats about 20 people max (I might even be wrong) so reservations are a must if you\\'re planning on going here during the dinner rush. Came here with the boy on a Wednesday evening when they opened (5 pm) for their dinner service &, already, the restaurant was getting close to full. I eat dinner early (insert *shrugging* emoji here). The place, albeit tiny, is clean but it does have a \"smell,\" which I wasn\\'t a fan of. I\\'m not sure if it was because it was super hot in the city that day & it just accentuated the fishy smell but I was a bit turned off. To be fair, it wasn\\'t THAT bad but I\\'m very sensitive to smells and so I didn\\'t enjoy the weird stench. Thankfully, we were seated near the register where they had candles that helped mask the smell. Service was just OK. I had to catch their attention several times to order, for more water/tea, and even for the check. Now to the food; I thought the food was delicious. The fish was fresh and, surprisingly, not fishy tasting. I ordered some rolls because: 1. my initial reaction to the smell of the restaurant, 2. I\\'m always apprehensive about getting nigiri at relatively new places so I take the safe route and order rolls first before venturing into nigiriWe ordered the 49er roll, negihama, and the rainbow roll. Safe orders. All were great! We even ordered another negihama after. The boy ordered the Unagi Don, which I tasted, and the unagi was cooked perfectly! It was soft, flaky, the edges crunchy, and the sauce was not overly sweet. Portion size was on par with SF prices. Next time, I\\'m going to try the nigiri & the dons (which I probably should\\'ve but I wasn\\'t sure how big the portions were and I wasn\\'t very hungry at the time). Now for the highlight, I was pleasantly surprised that every Wednesday, ALL DAY, is dollar oysters! We had no plans of going here that Wednesday but I\\'m so happy we did. ALL DAY dollar oysters! It\\'s their pacific oysters that are $1 BUT their miyagis & kusshis (both my go-to oyster orders) are also cheaper during their dollar oyster day. I think this is a major win as I pay full price elsewhere for these babies. You can get 20% off their rolls if you check-in via Yelp but I forgot so hopefully they still offer that the next time I come here to eat. They also gave me 15% off rolls for dine-in so that was nice. All-in-all, I\\'d come back. For sure on Wednesdays for their dollar oysters but also for the quality of their sushi.',\n",

Not sure if that's the traditional way but I've never seen it before and fell in love. You're supposed to wrap bite sized rolls with the contents of your bowl into the little seaweed pieces that are provided with your dish. I opted for the Kaisen Don #2 ($18.95) but I wish I had gotten the Scallop Lover ($16.95) instead. I don't think the crab legs were worth the extra $2 and the scallop was so clean and fresh, the Scallop Lover would have been a better option for me.

       "  'review': \"I really wanted to love this place but the stomach pain that I had almost immediately after I finished my bowl made me feel otherwise. I ordered the Kaisen Don, which had scallops, crab legs, and ikura. Two of the four scallops that I had in my bowl tasted funny - kind of a stinging/sour feeling in my mouth. I disregarded it the first time, hoping that the feeling was just from the wasabi, but when I got the same taste after not using any wasabi, I knew it was the scallop. Either way, I still finished my bowl (big mistake), but I had a pretty intense stomachache after I left. Luckily, it didn't last the whole night. Maybe I just got unlucky with a few bad pieces of scallop, since, judging from reviews this doesn't happen often. On the other hand, my boyfriend ordered the Rainbow Don, which I also tried a bit of. His bowl was great, the fish tasted fresh and we both really liked how they give you strips of seaweed on the side to make your own sushi roll. Every bowl also comes with complimentary miso soup. They also have hot bowls with chasiu or unagi, etc. I would say that the chirashi bowls are on the pricer side, around $20-30 per bowl, with the hot bowls a little cheaper. I might be willing to go back to try their other options, but definitely won't be getting any of the scallops!\",\n",

My spicy salmon taco was fresh and delicious-buttery salmon, a nice crunch of masago and nori, and a bed of soft, warm rice. I almost ordered a salmon don, but wasn't sure how big it was and didn't want to spend that much money. I also wanted to eat small portions, so I could try multiple food items from different stalls. I saw some other people get the salmon don and it honestly wasn't that big, so I could've ate it. Oh well. The service was quick once I ordered, but the prices were expensive.

       "  'review': \"First place I wanted to try coming back home was Kaisen Don. Thank you Yelp. 20% off Chirashi bowls? YES.This means that the most bang for your buck is to order the most expensive one. And that's what I did. I got the Omakase Don $28.95 which included Tako, Hamachi, Salmon, Ikura, Tuna, Ebi, AND Uni. The Uni wasn't specified in the menu or picture, but I got it anyways. Merry Christmas to me! The restaurant is small and limited to small parties. The menu is simple as it comes with different kinds of dons (donburis). Although not stated in the menu, it comes with a bowl of mushroom miso soup which was a delightful start to the meal. The bowl takes quite a while to make as I'm sure they prepare it fresh.  My thoughts, if you've been to Grubbies, I find this place awfully resembling of it. The cute fish logo reminds me of their fish soy packets and the bowls were kinda similar in style. The fish tasted fresh, but immediately entering place \\xa0you can smell the fishiness. The pieces of fish are of good size but some pieces were oddly sliced. The fish was good, but something was missing as the texture was non-existent. Salmon was bland, toro was lean, and ebi was skimpy looking. Uni was fine ... but lacked sweetness. Lastly, the rice was too unportional sticky. Fortunately the good thing was the tamago, ikura, and tako. +Tamago was sweet and firm+Ikura was like tiny dragon balls that popped nicely in your mouth+Tako was tender++Seaweed pieces were great as it provided extra flavor and textureI've had better for cheaper. The fact it is located near SF State, I'm sure it'll attract the millenials, me being one of them. 20% discount is a good deal and that's probably the only reason I'll be coming back along with Super Cue right there.****For another review of this place: My brother Derek L.\",\n",

I've gotten the Rainbow don to go and while they were out of yellowtail, the woman behind the counter let me know that she subbed in some scallop and ikura - a pleasant surprise!I love chirashi bowls, and while this might not be a weekly meal for me, I'll definitely make it a point to bring my starving boyfriend here. The price point is pretty solid considering the quality and amount of raw fish. Comparable to even ordering the same amount of nigiri (raw fish on top of a little mound of rice), actually. The bowls come with a standard miso soup and some seaweed.Service can be a little slow in the evenings if just one person is working, but they've been really friendly. You would think that it would be more crowded considering the yoga and gym crowd around the corner...They're still working the little kinks out, but I'm digging their logo and food.

       "  'review': \"First off, if you've been to tsukiji market in Tokyo then you'd really appreciate this restaurant... I wanna say it's the first of its kind in the Bay Area since I haven't seen anything similar around the area. But it's pretty much different selections of chirashi (fish over rice), exactly like how they serve it in tsukiji. For this reason alone, it gets a higher rating from me...As far as my experience here is concerned, I think there's definitely some improvements to be had, but they're still in the soft opening stages so guess I'll give them some slack... the main issue that I saw on my visit was the lack of efficiency/staff (tables were not being cleaned, which meant longer wait time). Other than that, service was very good.Food wise... the taste and freshness was there. I ordered the ikura/uni don and the ikura tasted exceptional! It was very well marinated with a balance of sweetness and saltiness, probably one of the best I've tasted (even compared to Japan). The uni was also very fresh with no fishy-ness whatsoever. BUT....... even though it tasted good, there was a slight issue with it. The amount of ikura WAS NOT the same as advertised... and for $30, I'd expect the rice to be fully covered. Although, there is still the 20% soft opening discount, so I guess I won't complain too much :pOverall verdict... I'll definitely be back for more! Cause the other stuff looks good too.\",\n",

Only one other table filled in the restaurant. Parking was a bit of a nightmare bc this spot is pretty close to the 24hr fitness on Ocean. Anyways, within 30mins of our meal, the entire spot was packed. In fact, by the time we were leaving, there was at least 3 groups waiting to be seated. So come hungry, come early!As for the food choices, there's just about a dozen to choose from. I was mostly disappointed bc I didn't see an option with uni + fish. I misread a previous post that said their uni specials are wknights only. AH. But otherwise, my friend and I both stuck with the Rainbow Don option, which was delish. The fresh salmon, hamachi, tuna sashimi pieces were massive and came with a refreshing slice of lemon each, on top of a bed of pebbled sushi rice. A TON of rice. We felt wasteful bc we couldn't even get through half of our rice!With 20% off during their soft opening, it made for a great (more) budget friendly lunch option. I'd come back again on a wknight to try the uni special! 4 stars :)\",\n",

The parking wasn't too bad, but it was all street parking. My friend and I both decided on the Rainbow Don, which cane with salmon, hamachi, and tuna. They didn't have tuna that day, so I subbed for scallops. The portions were decent, and the sashimi slices were fatty. It came with seaweed strips, which ended up being a good idea with the sashimi and rice. Of the three sashimi choices, my favorite was the salmon. The scallop has somewhat of an unusual taste, and they weren't sweet and fresh like they usually should taste. Prices are a little high for the chirachi here but nonetheless, a pretty good experience overall!\",\n",

The bowls are very similar, except the rainbow don has a variety of fish instead of just salmon. If you like raw fish, I'd recommend the rainbow don instead of the salmon ikura don because it has more slices of fish (unless you love roe then get salmon). All the fish were fresh and the rice was very addicting. It comes with a side of seaweed so we made our own mini sushi wraps.Service was great, but it should be since the restaurant isn't that big.

The squid & scallop were also extremely disappointing - leaving a gross aftertaste in both of our mouths. The rice was ok.- Rainbow Don $19We ordered this based off of yelp reviews but don't be fooled. I didn't know a rainbow only had 3 colors.. but there were only 3 sashimi options offered with this & only 1 out of the 3 actually tasted decent.ETC:- Parking may be difficult, as it's on a very busy street.Given that it seems like a fairly new restaurant, we might consider coming back.. or not.

Super consistent and so much fresh uni!!!!Kaisen Don is a fantastic little chirashi joint that I have wished into existence. Chirashi is my favorite way to eat sushi.I have been here 3-4 times. Most of the time, I order the Omakase Don and it\\'s always creative and delicious. Last time, in addition to the medley of delicious seafood atop a perfectly cooked bowl of rice, it came with a small slice of foie gras. Another time, it came with truffled scallops. Always comes with a spot of uni and is so delicious.The presentation and plating of the sushi here is a clear indication that the chefs in the kitchen know what they\\'re doing and care about their craft. Everything is so beautiful, it\\'s hard to dig in!I have also ordered the more simple chirasi, which is tasty and fresh. The miso soup tastes as if it was made with bonito, which is something that is missing from most casual Japanese restaurants.I wish they sold a simple beer here, such as Sapporo or Orion. I\\'m guessing they don\\'t have an on-sale beer and wine license.This place is not for \"cheap eats\" but is priced fairly for the quality and quantity of food. Good luck finding chirasi this good for less anywhere in SF.Keep up the good work, Kaisen!',\n",

       "  'review': \"Pricey but yum. Came here a while back. like a while back, but never wrote a review. Tried their Rainbow Don ($18.95) and NegiToro Don ($35.95). The rainbow don came with 3 pieces of hamachi, tuna, salmon, and cucumber over a bowl of rice. Sashimi was fresh and nicely sliced. The toro don was made with chopped up fatty tuna under ikura. Not sure I liked the chopped up toro with the rice by itself, but wrapped in the seaweed was like a negi toro handroll which was great (LOVE negi toro). They gave us about 3-4 pieces of seaweed which wasn't enough so we had to keep asking for more seaweed and that was an additional cost. We also ordered a side order of scallop sashimi which was also fresh. Overall, a very yummy meal but not completely filling. And for $20-30 for a bowl was pretty fricken pricey for the portion plus the additional costs for the seaweed is crazy. Haven't made a trip back since then but I noticed they offer more now and even have nigiri's.\",\n",

They gave lots of scallops and salmon roe all over it, so good with the rice!Omakase Bowl: RECOMMEND! If you want a bit of everything, this hits the spot. The amount of fish they give is generous and each bite was pure happiness to my tummy.Overall, I would come here again!

       "  'review': \"There aren't many chirashi places in San Francisco, so I was excited to see this place in my recommendations. TL;DR Despite the positive//negative reviews, try this place for yourself because you won't regret it!It's a small restaurant with seating for only ~20 people so the wait may be longer than usual. I went in around 8:30 on a Friday and waited till 8:55 before getting a table for 2.We ordered an Omakase Don ($26.95) and a Gyu Don (13.95). The Omakase Don had various types of fish, but it was your basics (tuna, salmon, hamachi, etc.). The Gyu Don is pretty much a beef sukiyaki bowl. The fish is fresh and sukiyaki is well made, not too salty and not too sweet. However, there is a problem with both of these bowls - too much rice! There was so much rice in the Omakase Don that half of the bowl was still full. There was a lot of filler on the Omakase Don - I truly hope they decide to add more fish on it, then the $26.95 would justify it.Overall, I had a great experience here, the employees are friendly and pretty hardworking. I think that only two people work here and it can get overwhelming for them. If you're the manager, help them out and hire one more person!\",\n",

Miso soup was complimentary. However, the prices are a little high. Place is pretty small and it threw me off when there was a very strong fish smell as soon as I walked in. My jean jacket still has the smell of fish stuck to it. My favorite item that was ordered would be the uni scallop burger. The uni scallop burger has black truffle sauce stuffed inside. Each burger is $10. This item isn't listed on the actual menu but is written on a very small chalkboard near the cash register. If it wasn't for yelp, I wouldn't have known this item existed. Other items ordered were the Kaisen spoon (oyster topped with uni), salmon ikura don, and chashu don. Salmon ikura don was about $20. It was good but I don't think it was worth $20!? Luckily, there was a 10% discount for the yelp check in!\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Came here with the recommendation from a good friend. We showed up around 8pm on a tuesday night and was seated promptly. The restaurant is small, somewhat hidden amongst all the businesses on Ocean Avenue. It's right across the street from 24 hour as a marker. Probably not an ideal location for a big party. Overall, we would say that the meal was enjoyable. As someone that loves fresh fish and Chirashi style meals, I had really high hopes that Kaisen Don was going to live up to the hype.Both the BF and I ordered the Omakase Don which looked beautiful, but for what it was was, I can't say that we were blown away by the quality nor the quantity of the bowl. Like another yelper mentioned, the rice has too much vinegar and the rice to fish ratio was poor. I know quality fresh seafood is pricey, and I expected that, but overall I can't say that the meal was memorable. I've definitely had more enjoyable chirashi dons at other places for better pricing and quality. Unfortunately, there was a very strong fish odor when you walk into the restaurant. I know, i know, it's a fresh sushi/sashimi restaurant, of course, it will smell like fish. However, the smell was overwhelming and a bit offputting. I believe the best thing we had that night was the scallop truffle burger. It tasted great..but I can't justify the price in the future. Would I come back? Probably if i felt like splurging. Would I recommend it to a friend? I'm not sure. Like I said, unfortunately, the meal was not memorable for me. What I do praise is the owner's passion for wanting to bring something he loved from Japan to here. The execution was a good homage to the bowls that we would eat in Japan and it's a great addition to Ocean. All in all, it's a local/private business that is worth checking out if you're okay with spending a little more on your meal for seafood.\",\n",

There were 2 servers serving 5 tables. No water or anyone to take orders for my table for at least 15 mins. I know some who had twice amount of tables by themselves and still manage to provide awesome service.Smell - 2 stars. Ok, I know it's a sushi restaurant but does it have to smell that fishy. Can't say it is a really good date spot because of that especially if your so has a sensitive sense of smell. Maybe that's why they get more takeouts.Uni tray - fresh but a tad overpriced compared to some places in LA. I wouldn't recommend getting it here unless you want to splurge for the tray. Still a little pricy at $108 but good at least you wouldn't leave wanting more or at least not right away. I'll give it 3.5 stars.Tacos - 5 stars (Winner of the night!)Sashimi quality - 5 stars\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I've had good experiences with Chirashi bowls, and I was excited to try this place since it's close by and there aren't many places like it in the neighborhood. The place was cute! I liked the hip wooden decor and minimalistic branding. It is small, but we got there before noon, so there was still lots of seating. We got the Kaisen Don #1 and the Rainbow Don. We waited a bit for our food to come out, but it wasn't too bad. And, we had some miso soup to sip on while we waited. I was pleasantly surprised when we got our food. The bowls were so beautiful, especially the Kaisen Don! \\xa0Each piece of fish seemed meticulously place. I loved the little wasabi stamped with the store logo. They give you really crisp seaweed on the side to go with your bowl. I liked how the wasabi on the milder side, not as nose-tingling as other places,. The fish and shrimp was very fresh, not fishy at all. And it was a fair amount of fish for what we paid for. The flavor of the sushi rice was good, not overpowering, and the texture was nice and sticky. The amount of rice was typical for a Chirashi bowl. I wasn't a huge fan of the tamago as it was too sweet for me. I typically like it saltier, but it was nice and firm. It was a good amount of food for me, so I was pretty full by the end of the meal. The owner was very nice and came by to refill our cups whenever we ran out of tea. Overall, it was a great experience, and I would definitely come back again. They mentioned they would be adding more stuff to the menu in January! I'm excited to try the new stuff!\",\n",

Four stars for their creativity and simplicity in opening a place that only serves donburis. Don\\'t expect anything more but don\\'t expect anything less either.A \"don\" is short for Donburi which is basically meat and rice in Japanese food language. They offer around 15 different dons - ranging from the Omakase don to cooked items like Teriyaki Chicken don. For three girls, we ordered:Omakase don - features a range of different sashimi at two to three pieces each: uni, hamachi, tamago, salmon, toro, tuna. Rainbow don: another mix of sashimi, very similar to the omakase donScallop Lover don: scallop sashimi with Ikura Unagi don: unagi with sauce over riceWe came in on a Saturday night, 630pm for three, about a 20 min wait. Their fish overall is fresh, better end of Japanese restaurants. They give you enough fish a lot of rice and ikura. We ended up taking the seaweed pieces they gave us to make Ikura nigiris. They are still in their soft opening phase. Very apparent with their furnishing and this place is small. Imagine a newly painted apartment living room with open kitchen split in half for you to only dine in the living room portion. Would not recommend a party of more than four. Not cozy at all, pretty bare but comfortable enough for dinner. Overall, I would return because I do want to try their Uni special which is only available Tues-Thurs. Otherwise, it would be a go to place for take out donburis! I would not wait more than thirty mins for this place. Just get the take out instead if you have a rainy day.',\n",

I LOVE chirashi bowls and to see that they combined an omakase experience into one bowl, I just really wanted to try the concept. It is currently still soft opening and a Monday night, so the restaurant was empty except for the lady and I. I like the small feel as it does help me feel like the food isn't mass produced to meet the demand, but carefully crafted to impress a small audience at a time. I ordered an Omakase Bowl and was impressed by the presentation. See picture for what I really mean as words are kind of hard to explain! The one gripe I have about and -1 Star for is its kind of hard to eat. The wasabi is right smack in the middle, the ginger is bundled to the side, radish(?) shreds are supporting the fish, but the rice is almost impossible to get to. We also ordered the spoons, which were alright, and I have mixed feelings about them being $7/spoon. One thing for sure is the quality of the seafood and the time and effort put into each dish.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Came here Thursday evening and there wasn't a line which is great. We ordered Omakase don and Negitoro don and a Hamachi Kama. I was expecting the Omakase don like the ones I see on pictures with crab but I have the baby octopus instead, and I thought for that price, the baby octopus shouldn't be in that bowl and there should be a bit more quantity to the bowl. However, the quality of the other fishes has wowed me enough, so I give it a 5 star. For the Negitoro don, it was the most expensive item on the menu, and we expected pieces of blue fin tuna toro bedded on top of sushi rice, but instead it was minced toro tuna. We thought chopping up the toro would be such a waste of a good fish, but surprisingly, the minced tuna rice and salmon roe and roasted seaweed flakes were a perfect combination, it was so good that we finished that bowl in just a sec. I also have to make a comment on their Salmon roe. The only time I had Salmon roe that is not fishy was the time when I travel in Japan. But this place rocks that Salmon Roe. IT IS NOT FISHY AT ALL. Lastly, the Hamachi kama was cooked perfectly. The portion is big and the meat are so tender and juicy. We usually will order Hamachi kama whenever we dine at Japanese restaurant, but never had any Hamachi Kama with this quality and size. We will definitely come back!\",\n",

There were a few bowls that they were out of, so be prepared with 2nd and 3rd choices when you order.All of our orders came with miso soup to start. My scallops tasted fresh and there was enough protein to satisfy me. The cooked donburi bowls take a bit longer to prepare (obviously), and they don't bring everything out at the same time. Service was good. Overall, would come back.\",\n",

I recommend that one either take the muni or uber. Since they are brand new, they had a 20% off grand opening special which I took advantage of. I got their rainbow bowl. I haven't gotten their uni bowl but I definitely will in the future, hopefully.The bowl was good, with thick cuts of raw fish. There was lots of rice underneath after I finished the rice. The restaurant itself is tiny. It's much better for take out. Pricey but then again, it's SF and raw fish.\",\n",

The fish here is amazing, and incredibly fresh- especially the salmon, and it looks like the bowls are seasonal. The fish slices are hefty, you definitely get your money's worth. Tea and miso soup and served, and our waiter was highly attentive. They also gave you nori pieces!! There aren't any don places here, (Japanese dish over rice) so it's exciting to have one with such fresh fish nearby. Definitely recommend stopping by, definitely coming back. The one thing I also really appreciated was the authenticity of the place. We just came back from japan, but we felt like they definitely got it right. It would be nice if in the future they could offer half portions. I was so stuffed I felt like I couldn't move. Worth it, but half portion would have been great too. Good luck!\",\n",

       "  'review': \"A hidden don spot! (Dons are short for donburi which are Japanese rice bowls!)Kaisen Don is a new donburi restaurant. They have a wide menu; from curry dons, to unagi dons, and even chirashi dons! (fresh fish dons). This looked like a cool new place to try!My friend and I came at around 7pm on a Monday night. Parking here is atrocious so just a heads up! The restaurant is tiny and most of the tables were filled. Luckily there was some open spaces so my friend and I did not have to wait!My friend and I both ordered the Rainbow Don (Hamachi (yellow tail), Ikura Roe, Tuna, Salmon, cucumbers, sushi rice, ginger, and wasabi). When you order a don, you get a complimentary miso soup! The miso soup was a bit on a salty side for me, but beyond that it was good classic miso soup.The Rainbow don here is the main attraction for me. First and foremost the presentation of the don cannot be understated. It looked gorgeous and the various colors and textures made it pleasing to the eye. Overall, I liked this dish a lot! The portion size was definitely small, but the quality of the fish and overall ingredients were good. The fishes definitely all had a good amount of fat for me and the taste of each individual fish could be distinguished. However, I definitely think the sushi rice could have been a bit more flavored for me. I didn't realize it was sushi rice until 1/4 of the way in.Overall while this was an expensive experience it was one to remember. The service here was also very good and friendly, it is something I really appreciated! A lot of the dons are rather expensive, but they have a ton of dons here to try and the rainbow don was definitely something I enjoyed!\",\n",

In terms of value, I've definitely had other chirashi bowls I find more worth it but this place isn't bad at all. Everything was fresh and delicious but portion was a bit small for guys especially.The complimentary miso soup was very bland. It was like drinking hot water :/ I had the Kaisen Don, it was good! I saw on other yelp posts that there seems to be a Kaisen Don #1 & #2 but the waitress said there's only one Kaisen Don so that was slightly confusing.I really wanted to try the appetizers (kaisen spoon $7/ea. & scallop burger $10/ea.) but they just seem a bit too pricy for the quantity.Definitely worth trying but I'm not 100% on coming back because of the price.\",\n",

Second time around... they messed up on a few things. They gave us miso soup with no spoons (we got them the first time). The portion size was smaller. They no longer serve our dishes with the seaweed wraps. The wasabi was sloppily placed in our bowls. No more shaped in the restaurant\\'s logo. Did they just get lazy & didn\\'t care anymore? Water was never refilled. And since when did they charge for \"hot\" tea? It was lukewarm at best and also never refilled. Maybe this would be considered nitpicking, but come on. Missing the basic things is a no-no in my book.Side note: food is okay. Not excellent. Would we come back to this place... good questions. Likelyhood in the near future would be a \"no\".',\n",

Order a scallop appetizer (come in 4 pieces), the 4 pieces is just one scallop slice in 4 pieces really thin and that's cost $10 which is not worth it at all. One piece of scallop is $10. I never have a scallop cost that much. Stupid. There is a lot of place is much better then this place. Service is not that good either. Ask for the check and it take them 20 mins to give the check. They only give you the iPad to pay for it so I don't know why it take them so long to give me the check if it's pay from the iPad. Terrible.\",\n",

It also smells strongly like the ocean (brininess). For those trying this place for the first time, I suggest going hard and trying their omakase don. If you're not a fan of raw fish, their unagi don is made to order and delicious (it can be too much of the same texture/taste for some due to the quantity you're getting). The salmon ochazuke is also a good Asian comfort dish, it's very remeniscent of porridge; something I would order if I was sick. All in all, I think this place is worth trying and has become one of my go to places for good sashimi that isn't a Michelin star restaurant. Plus, you can order a goddamn tray of uni here, please.\",\n",

It was on a bed of rice and came with shaved radish, some cucumber slices, and wasabi/ginger. It was really straight forward. I really liked the rice actually. (When you walk in, it smells of vinegar rice.) Their fish is fresh and it was a good enough portion to feel satisfied. I broke up some of my fish chunks, eating them in half piece for better portioning with rice and nori. I would say that their service is good. Wendy was our server and she was very friendly. I'm just confused on whether this is a place where you go up to the counter to pay... After our bowls were taken, the check never came. Our server came later with an ipad to ring us up, but to me, it's just an awkward paying experience because what if I wanted to spilt the bill differently or something. I'm not sure, next time I'll just be more direct. I'll definitely be back. I liked it a lot.\",\n",

I saw the reviews on Yelp and I thought, I knew, I really hoped it would be the best sushi I had in a long time. I ordered the Uni, Ikura Don. I was pleased by the freshness and presentation but disappointed with the quantity. Paying $29 for 4 Uni which 3 pieces were very small did not compare to the pictures on the menu or the Yelp reviews. The Ikura was plentiful and lots of rice but for a premium price I expectedly least 6 pieces of Uni and large pieces like the photos. The Miso soup was barely warm. Very disappointed in the soup. The hot tea was good. I want to return to try other dishes but there are so many places I feel are better deals and better prices I likely won't return. Only a 3 star rating because of price and quantity did not meet my expectations. Service was good and the place is clean. But the 6 table restaurant only seats 16 people. I've seen hole in the wall restaurants grow into huge successes by exceeding all areas of importance. Quality, price, and quantity. Service is 4th on my list but everyone is different. Not talking about bad service just service is last to quality of food, price for value, and quantity so you feel good about a deal. I don't feel like I got a good deal this time.\",\n",

Rice is extremely important in Japanese cuisine, especially for rice bowls. The rice here isn't cooked or seasoned the right way. I understand there's more than one way to season rice, but Kaisen Don's rice isn't authentic. Their method for cooking rice and for seasoning rice aren't on par with other Japanese restaurants that fall into the same price point. I've been to Japan and other Japanese restaurants located in the nation, and I don't touch rice unless it's good. Hence, it's very disappointing that the only options they have here are rice bowls with disappointing rice.\",\n",

It\\'s kind of far if you live centrally in San Francisco, but it\\'s right off the public transportation line so it\\'s not a terrible trek.For their soft opening, 20% off was an awesome deal. We got the omakase don and rainbow don. It comes with miso soup and tea gratuit. The service was friendly and it wasn\\'t difficult to get a seat at 6pm (nor was it hard for anyone who walked in after us to up until 7pm). One thing I loved was the amount of fish that you get on top of the chirashi bowl - Kaisen Don is by far one of the more generous places. As for improvements: the rice (as others have mentioned) and quality of wasabi are in need of help. I\\'m kind of picky about my rice, but I think it could have used more seasoning or \"sushi rice flavor\". The menu pictures also don\\'t exactly match what you get... For example in the omakase don, no uni is pictured, but you do get uni in your bowl. A simple difference like that could entirely change my decision if I want a bowl or not! Granted that they\\'ve only been open a month and are still working a few things out, I think they have the potential to build out a strong following of Yelpers and diners soon. :)',\n",

I was warned in prior yelp reviews about the fish to rice portion, but I didn't think too much of it. When does anyone not complain about how much rice you get? It did seem like a lot of rice, but I didn't think it was excessive. Since it was a weeknight, they had their uni trays and we got the 1/2 tray. It was delicious and creamy. I was pretty happy with the portion as well. At first, it looked like five pieces on five cucumbers with a sprinkle of ikura, but it was about three pieces on top of each other. I also got the omakase don and it was well worth it. It had salmon, tako, tamago, ikura, uni, scallops, hamachi. Everything was really fresh tasting and I was pretty content with the dish. I was pretty stuffed at the end of it. Their menu prices changed to be a bit lower. We received three menus with the pricing and then one menu with the changed pricing. I'm sure they are still adjusting in the early stages. The omakase was $28.95 originally but was lowered to $24.95. I thought the prices were pretty reasonable for what you get. I'd come back whenever I need a chirashi fix.\",\n",

So maybe they are figuring out what works best?The sushi rice the first time was decent but the second time, it was bland, tasted like normal rice not sushi rice.the only solid constant was the sashimi, always tastes fresh and nicely cut, so that is great.They also give a good amount of ikura, (happy husband)my rainbow don- first time I had tamago, and maybe one slice less of each sashimi? second time, I was like \"oh yay they added more!..but wait! where is my tamago?\"so I\\'m not sure which is the correct version, I think it\\'s the second one, since the recent pictures look like what I got.Both versions were fine, but when you are expecting something and don\\'t get it, it can be disappointing. we also were given seaweed packets the second time, which was very nice!my only other irk was that we ordered over the phone, but it still took a while to get our meal....and they didn\\'t seem that busy? Ah well, like my husband said, they could have had LOTS of to-go orders...we\\'ll still definitely come by again for their fresh chirashi bowls...a little too much rice in my opinion though...worth it with their 20%',\n",

       "  'review': 'This is more of a 1.5 star review. Anyone with a 3+ star review has either:-never had a decent chirashi bowl-has a diet consisting of Old Town chirashi (see above)-was high while eatingWhy?I know its 20% off, but is it also 20% off the portions as well? I ordered the Kaisen Don #1, but at full price, I would not. Its about $19 for the bowl. At that price, I\\'m expecting an extra slice of salmon or 2 and one more sweet shrimp. Also leave the lemon out, it just doesn\\'t go with the bowl.As for the taste, its alright, but not worth $19-alright. The rice was plain, where\\'s the seasoning/rice vinegar? Hello? I mean it\\'s just rice but the rice vinegar makes a big difference especially when paired with raw fish. Also, get rid of the lemon, the lemon rubs onto the fish and partially masks the freshness the taste/freshness of the fish. Unless you\\'re using shitty fish, get rid of the shitty lemon. Once you use rice vinegar, the lemon will be too overbearing anyways. Or put it to the side if you insist putting lemon in the bowl.Another, the thickness of the cut of the fish. The salmon were basically in blocks in my don (there\\'s much photographic proof that this is so on this yelp page). Just look at the photos, they\\'re goddamn 2-match-box-combined sized chunks.The reason why a lot of chirashi places have thinner slices is so people can easily wrap their fish around their rice and dip it in sauce. But instead, you have a block of salmon which you eat separately from the rice. The radish. The goddamn pile of #radish.Sure it makes it instagrammable or whatever, but nobody eats that much radish with chirashi. If you insist on leaving that much radish then at least place it over a leaf/seaweed/lettuce so people can pull out all the radish in one fell swoop instead of picking at it to remove it.Just from these small but important details you can tell these guys were just like \"Oh hey let\\'s just open a Chirashi place because it\\'s easy to make the food and it\\'s popular\" without much regard on how Chirashi is supposed to be made.One more thing to pick at: \"bringing Tsukiji\\'s food CULTURE\". So is the fish from Tsukiji or are you guys only talking about the food culture in which they have fresh fish everyday? Because this place is literally just fish over rice and not how chirashi actually is.I think this place can be a lot better. I think SF needs more chirashi places like this one BUT BETTER. I hope my review has given you some insight what to expect (as a potential customer) and what can be improved (as the owner). I\\'m hoping when I give this place a 2nd chance in a month or so, it\\'ll become a place I can bring my friends without feeling embarrassed.',\n",

What bothered me was that the wasabi and ginger were in the bowl, and that the rice isn't sushi rice but it's not plain rice either. Also, the server was trying to organize the chopsticks and napkins and dropped them on the floor, and then placed them on the table. Um... am I wiping my mouth with a napkin that fell on the floor??? Anyways, maybe it's better if they do a pick up only, I was pretty disappointed in the experience.\",\n",

I get sushi, sashimi and chirashi bowls all the time. What makes a Japanese place more unique or better than the others? Not that much. Its just gotta have yummy fresh fish and great service.So I came to celebrate my father with an outting with my family. I got there early and asked about the Nigiri Omasake that was not on the menu bc i saw it on Instagram as a new dish and knew my dad would l-o-v-e it. So I asked and they told me they only serve it at lunch bc at dinner they are busy and understaffed. No problem. Fair. It was dinner time and there was like only 5 people in the whole restaurant. Fair, maybe it does get busy. 10min later, he serves the table next to me that \"Nigiri Omasake\" that I had asked about that is \"only served at lunch\". Funny I thought, so I looked at him and gestured and had a confused look on my face and he said \"Oh they are for Instagram\". Wow. I have a foodie account on Instagram too and was planning to post about it but I came here to have dinner with my family too. But because I am not for Instagram, I can\\'t order it? It would be totally fine if it was a standard rule but just minutes after I was told it was not serve-able, its served right by me? When I had seen it on Instagram so I came here?Really horrible experience. Food was just fine. Service aside from the above wasn\\'t memorable. But I really didn\\'t appreciate the customer experience as a whole. When we were eatting, nobody else walked in and it was just as empty as when I had asked about the \"Nigiri Omasake\". I would have appreciated it if he had offered to serve it after I clearly was not happy. Didn\\'t attempt to try and make up my displeasure. If all that didn\\'t didn\\'t happen, I would have given 3 stars bc this place isn\\'t that special and I have other Japanese places to go to that have better service and food in general. Gotta work on your customer service.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Pluses are:* Super fresh fish - plus the ikura was glistening and popped in your mouth! Also, slices are good sized (1/4\" thick). * Wide selection of bowls - if you aren\\'t into fresh fish, you should go somewhere else, this is Kaisen Don meaning \"sashimi fish on rice\"! If they were a true Kaisen Don as their name suggests, then this would be true. However they do offer beef, salmon or beef curry on rice among other things.* Friendly owner* Continued 20% off discount after soft openingCons:* Weird/small table layout - I realize they are still working things out, but after 1 month they need to get this squared. Waiting families had no where to sit, but stand against the wall?!? When we were there, the layout was a definite fire hazard and non-handicapped compliant.* Unusually long wait time - we had to wait about 25 minutes after ordering to get our bowls. Fish put on rice. That is essentially what the bowls are. Felt awkward when people waiting for a table are almost right in your face.* Cost - borderline high. The 20% discount helped, but I think that people should take photos with some reference in it like a phone or something. *I shouldn\\'t talk as I didn\\'t do it either.* In the photos the bowls \"seem\" big and packed with goodies. Again, the fish is super fresh. But we actually left a little hungry.Lastly, I hope that this restaurant tries to understand the minute differences that true Japanese restaurants reflect. A huge plus they already have is the quality of fish. However, omakase means to \"let the chef decide\". It does not mean \"put a little of each thing on the menu\". \"Omakase\" is meant for the best of the best that day, so what it includes will also change day to day. As a Japanese customer, it saddened me.',\n",

It's unfortunate that with most sushi restaurants, rice is an afterthought and the fish is main attraction when it should be entirely the other way around. The rice at Kaisen Don was close to a good texture but slightly too wet and mushy, and completely lacked in any flavor whatsoever. No signs of sushi-su or sweetness and it ended up completely bland, reminding me of plain white porridge, which is really unfortunate because this place seems promising.The fish, while not the best, was portioned very reasonably for the price. The nori provided was the highlight for me, I only wish that they provided a small dish to put them somewhere. I had to place them awkwardly on top of my don bowl as I ate, and ended up moving them onto my napkin.Overall, I'm looking forward to giving this place another try in the future.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"The first thing I want to get out of the way is that if you were expecting a replica of Tsukiji Market or a more authentic Japanese chirashi don you're going to be missing one big thing: the rice. Normally I wouldn't point out something that seems to inconsequential but since it's a location that leans marketing heavily on being inspired by Tsukiji, I was expecting it to feature the more heavily vinegared rice from Japan. \\xa0Without it, even though the ingredients were buttery and soft, you get the distinct impression that it feels there's too much rice. Let me be clear though: I don't actually think there is too much rice! Especially if you get a bowl with ikura, there's enough to go around. But WITHOUT a more flavored rice this is the impression you get, you can see this in other reviews as well.Some places mitigate this with sauces, like a poke bowl or similarly inspired chirashi dons. I get the impression they included the seaweed paper / nori to mitigate it here without adding sauces. Kaisen does try to be authentic in the bowl, you get just the fish / sea food, but without the strongly vinegar laden rice you get in Japan to compliment it, it's going to fall short of expectations. Those who've been to Japan will know it's the rice being bland, those who've never been to Japan misattribute the problem to being too much rice when there's the right amount, it's just unflavored.But at the end of the day, it's not bad and it's in my neighborhood and I always appreciate more options. The 20% off during soft opening till the 17th makes it a good deal, plus the customer service is very friendly and attentive. The decor is trendy and clean. This review is probably a 3.5 star, but I want small businesses to succeed so I round up instead of down.They were told me I could request more vinegar next time i order so I'll try that and keep praying that some place is bold enough to offer the good rice.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Picked up some dinner here a couple weeks ago. Small place with a couple of tables, probably seats around 15 people. The inside is nice and clean albeit a little plain. I ordered takeout for my girlfriend and I though since it was a cold night and I wanted to get home quickly to watch the Warriors game. The guy who took our takeout order was nice and gave us ample time to pick what we wanted.I don't 100% remember what she ordered but I believe it was the Kaisen Don #1 and I ordered the Rainbow Don. The fish was very fresh but unfortunately, the portions don't match the price. My girlfriend gets full pretty easily but she ended up still being slightly hungry. Personally, I think I might have needed two to fill me up. It's about 3 pieces of each fish in the don. I know in order for them to have premium fish quality, they have to charge higher than other places but the prices are still too high. For this specific order, I still ended up spending around $30, even with the 20% discount they offered. I don't think I could fathom the thought of coming here without that discount. It honestly had me craving some Poki Time at Westlake just because the fish portion at Kaisen Don just wasn't enough.I'm hoping that Kaisen Don can turn it around though. They have a great product but the prices are just too steep. I wish them the best!\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Came here on a Friday night with three others, and since they didn't do reservations, we were expecting a wait. Upon arrival, we almost missed the entire restaurant because it is a very small shop in the middle of the block fitting 20 people maximum. Small spot, but surprisingly no wait. We got there and were seated within 5 minutes. There was only 1 server working the whole floor, but she was friendly. They're known for their chirashi bowl so we ordered three: two Rainbow Don and one Salmon Scallop Don. The bowls were a good size and served with a side of seaweed for you to DIY. The rice was not bad, and the perfect amount to place with each piece of fish on seaweed. Fish and seaweed was pretty decent too. We also decided to try their specials of the day: Scallop Burger and Kaisen Spoon. The spoon was good, however I couldn't taste the uni on the spoon, mostly oyster - but still tasted okay. The miso soup that came with the chirashi bowls were like any miso soup served in town and probably not homemade. The scallop burger was extremely tiny and was one piece of scallop cut in half to fit the uni and truffles. The truffle flavor overpowered the scallop and uni so I didn't realize the scallop was so sweet until I had it in my chirashi bowl. Not the best I've had, but decent.\",\n",

The salmon didn't really have that glistening effect that I usually see on fatty salmon but the quality of it was pretty ok. I think the lemon helped make it more tasteful. Ehh I would probably skip the seaweed they give on a little tray. It was pretty stale and hard to bite into. I tried to bite a small piece of it, but it got stuck on my teeth LOL. The rice was pretty good too! Idk if they only put rice vinegar to it but it was pretty tasty with the fish. My friend's order didn't have enough fish for hers :/ I think she only had like 6 pieces compared to mine? I forgot her order! Either way, I think people should check this place out before the 20% off soft opening coupon expires because this place is pretty expensive! I do like how they have a sashimi bowl place here that I wouldn't need to go to downtown and try the Grubbies. Other than that, I don't think I would come back unless I really REALLY want to treat myself out!\",\n",

It was just plain rice which is a big disappointment. It felt like I was just having a big bowl of white rice with some fish on top. The rice was missing the vinegar, sugar and salt. The basic ingredients that you will have in sushi rice. I ordered the rainbow don and added an amai ebi to my don. My amai ebi was really small and what made it worst is that my friend got the exact same thing as me, rainbow don with amai ebi but her amai ebi was a regular size. I was upset that I got a really small ebi but my friend got a regular size and she was sitting right next to me. We are paying for the same price, so how come my ebi was so small. They should just give us the same size or add another small amai ebi on my bowl to make it seem like all the portions of the rice bowls are the same. But they charged us $10 for two amai ebi. The place is really small and they had one server working. It wasn't really busy the day we went and the server was nice and he refilled our teas from time to time. Overall, I just feel like everything is overpriced even with the 20% off for soft opening.\",\n",

Actually, the two poke places nearby this particular restaurant has better unagi than this place. They also give you miso soup with the donburi, which is nice, but it is also of average quality.

The little embossed wasabi puck was a cute touch. My very pleasant server, Larry, kept the tea flowing, welcome on this rainy day. Prices were fair for sushi fish. I'm told that the next iteration of their menu will have a vegetarian option, which my tamago and inari-loving kid will like. Her beer-loving dad hopes they get a liquor license, too.

I would like more ambiance going out to eat at that price point (~$20/bowl). We tried 4 different bowls. Mine was scallop and uni from the specials board. The scallops were good, but it's a very small portion for $20.95. The uni was just two small pieces. It had ikura, which was not mentioned as part of the bowl. Unfortunately, I don't like ikura. We asked for the 20%, and at first they said that was over. We told them we saw it on Yelp and they asked us to show it to them. The Yelp mobile phone version doesn't mention the 20% discount, but the Yelp desktop version did that day (and still does 4 days later as I write this review). The servers were nice enough and eventually they said the manager would extend the 20% discount to us. Overall, we it was a very underwhelming experience and we will not return.\",\n",

Their beer is great, and only $5-$6. Great prices, large communal tables, nice vibe overall. Highly recommend for a casual drink before dinner',\n",

       "  'review': \"I can't go to the haight without at stopping in Magnolias! Every single thing I've ever ordered off the menu has been delicious. The service is incredibly friendly, attentive, quick, and yet low key. The beers and ciders are awesome, everything about this place is winning. Today I had the deviled eggs and a friend chicken sandwich. My friend joined me about half way through my meal, we made room for her, got her a plate and she shared what I had ordered, and LOVED it!The menu fluctuates just slightly, but always the core same, apps, meat and cheese board, sausages, vegetarian things, plus soups and salads... I've had a bit of everything over the years and keep coming back for more. I haven't actually eaten at many places in the haight bc every time I'm in the neighborhood I gotta hit up Magnolias. Even when the line \\xa0looks long, they run a smooth operation, I'm always seated drinking and eating quickly. Love this place! I Highly recommend it, just go, you won't be disappointed\",\n",

She was attentive and offered us great insight based on what we were feeling. \\xa0The food was delicious. We got the cheesy grits (must try them) and then paired it with the meatballs. It was a combo recommended by our waitress and we were so happy when we started to dig in. The pairing was amazing literally so good. The only part I complain about is that it made me want seconds (kinda trying to stay on somewhat of a diet here.) My friend and I have made it a priority from now on to get our butts all the way from downtown to the Haight just so we can pig out here. I can not wait to try the mussels as it seems every table order them and they looked and smelled delicious.\",\n",

The owner and servers were very nice and friendly. The owner also recommend their best sellers for a light beer and IPA, he also gave us samples to taste. We got the Kalifornia Kolsch and the Oyster Stout (both beers have their own unique taste and very refreshing). For the food I got the sweet chili chicken wings (hella good!) and the steamed mussels with toasted bread (omg get this! They gave me like a big bowl of mussels! And it is very delicious!) The hubz got the Magnolia Burger with fries which is also very good! I can't stop eating the burger and fries! Total is about $70 for 4 pint of beers and good food, not bad! We will be back!\",\n",

When we lived in SF, we'd walk to the Haight and eat in this location - it was another name back then - in this crazy building that was once the home to the famous Magnolia Thunderpussy's. You can look it up, really!Anyway, when my daughter-in-law came to visit a couple of weeks ago, she wanted to see the Haight on our way back to Marin, so I drove her around and figured we'd walk around and find somewhere nice for lunch. I was pleasantly surprised when we passed Magnolia, to see not just beers but some fine looking food, so we took a gamble.Well, first the beers were great. I had a lager, she had an ale, and we were both very happy!Then the food came and we both gobbled up our entrees, which were fresh, hot, tasty, and right-sized portions.The best part might have been the people watching. We were seated by a window facing Haight, and I think Yelp would delete this review if I listed everything we saw during our lunch (some things I wish I hadn't). It's always a real slice of life there, and Magnolia's a great place to watch it happening.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Pretty good brunch. There was a short wait even at 2:15pm on a Sunday, but we were a group of two and were sat right away. The tables were generally pretty full throughout our 1-hour meal.People love the beer selection the most, but I'm not much of a beer drinker. No ciders except a pomegranate beer, which they gave me a tasting of, but it wasn't quite for me.THE SERVICE: Very friendly, quick, and aware of our needs. THE COST: $69.48 before tips for a light brunch for two.SNACK* Devils on Horseback ($3/ea) - 3.5 starsCan't go wrong with bacon-wrapped dates. Not super fresh, but still good.* Tartine (two slices $8) - 4 starsI really liked this combo of roasted corn, burrata, and honey on delicious bread.MEAT* Small board ($23) - 3.5 starsGood, but I wish meats had more flavor. The pate was too light/mousse-like for my taste. Great fruit compote.CHEESEAgain, the fruit compote was great. Both cheeses seemed a bit old. The Blue was very sharp.* Sheep, peparo ($6) - 3.5 stars* Blue, English stilton ($6) - 3.5 stars\",\n",

       "  'review': \"A great venue for Magnolia not only to showcase its own beers, but also to pair them with some solid food offerings.As for the beers, you can taste several at once with a tasting flight, and of the five I tried, I enjoyed the Aliciella Bitter and the Cole Porter the most. As for the food, there's a good selection of small plates, soups, and salads, as well as charcuterie and cheese plates, sausages, and heartier entrees. I tried the burger, which was tasty enough, although I'm pretty sure it was also the cause of an extended series of trips to the bathroom later that night.Service was fairly perfunctory. The venue is a relatively compact one, lending itself well to small groups. Still worth a visit if you like having some solid bites with your beer.\",\n",

Since I have a dog with me I had to sit outside and it was really cold, for some reason on this corner gets really windy and even with my jacket and my dogs jacket it was just way too cold. While I was here I decided to have their sour beer and it was one of the best sour beers I have ever had. I told myself I would definitely come back, and now I'm here on a sunny Sunday afternoon. It's still a little windy but at least tolerable. I got the sour beer again and I'm smiling from ear to ear. My dog is happy, I just ordered some sausages and they were fantastic. Thank god that Magnolia exists and their brewer know how to make sour beers and thank god their cooks know how to make good food!!!! I will be back for sure!!!!\",\n",

I ordered the $16 cod which I was excited about as it looked very crispy, was served with a generous portion, with some fries as well. Too bad I had to put that generous portion to waste as the fish was greasy on the outside (understandable as its fried), but also the fish was extremely soggy and mushy on the inside. I passed it around to my friends as I couldn't stomach it anymore, and they thought the same. I didn't bother complaining as the servers were hard to get a hold of the entire visit and I just wanted to leave at this point. My buddy ordered a burger, and he enjoyed it, but he literally currently thinks that it may have gave him food poisoning. \\xa0Come here for the beers, the food is questionable.\",\n",

The Rye was my preference as it was smooth and not overly hoppy, but wasn\\'t the coldest beer I\\'ve had served, but still good. \\xa0The India had more hoppy flavors and was nice and chilled. \\xa0For lunch, thumbs up for the burger cooked medium, adding smoked gouda and bacon - tasty and hit the spot! \\xa0Yes, definitely recommend the fries, they\\'re awesome if you\\'re a fresh fries fanatic. \\xa0A pricey burger at $18 with fries, but it was excellent. \\xa0If you just want fries, you can order those in a good size cone basket.Also ordered a spinach salad, very fresh ingredients with bacon and the feta melted in your mouth. \\xa0And finally tried the egg and ham brunch feature with side greens; this was good, but I think there are many other options I\\'d try next time.All in all, it\\'s a cool place to stop and enjoy brunch or meal, then walk off a few calories on the eclectic shops on Haight street. \\xa0Enjoy!!',\n",

       "  'review': 'I used to come here often over the last 10-15 years. Mostly with my friends after work to have some nice beer and often on Thursdays for the fried chicken special. One of my friends kids used to go to school with Dave\\'s (former owner and brewmaster) kids. I\\'m just mentioning this to draw up a picture of the cast of characters and what happened here. So my afore mentioned friend and I had established an every two months or so Thursday dinner coupled with beer. For years. He\\'s an acupuncturist and I am a bodyworker. We both have children and have to get up in the morning. We are both in our mid fifties and we are just regular people. So, after an approximately 6 months break we are having our usual dinner and we sit down and eat and order beer. After the 4th round of beer over the course of a couple of hours the waitress informs us that it is now \"company policy\" that nobody can be served more than 4 beers.???!!!??? Whaat?With all due respect, seeing that the place was half empty at the time, this has got to be in the top 5 of the worst business decision of all times. I will never go back here and I will not buy your beer in the store. With that kind of a business approach you\\'re gonna see a lot of money coming in!! And just as an aside, if this is for some reason NOT company policy and it was just the decision of the early 20s manager and waitress to see how far they can take it with two old guys, they should be fired immediately.As it stands you lost this group of customers and I have no intention to return.Good luck with your \\'gastro brew pub\\'',\n",

       "  'review': \"I've had Magnolia bookmarked for years, yet it's one of the few breweries in the city that has until now, escaped my attention. I would chock that up to the Haight being a difficult place to get to unless I'm on the hunt for Veganburg. We were in the area and my babygirl was satisfied from lunch, so that means I get to enjoy some beer. We walked over to a half empty Magnolia during happy hour. I ordered their sampler which is a unique triangular shaped box that holds their tall thin taster glasses that are half full to about 4oz. You get to choose your own sampler set from their fairly long (for a small brew pub) tap list. \\xa0Pretty much anything is available to sample save for a couple of high ABV choices on the right side of their pretty chalkboard menu. I wasn't overwhelmed in any way with their beer. They had a Winter Warmer that was my favorite. The Proving Ground IPA was decent. Their double IPA was a pure malt bomb that left a bitter taste in my mouth during the rest of the sampler.It's a nice spot with good service, outdoor seating, and a varied and rotating tap selection. I'll probably never return but that doesn't mean you shouldn't check it out. Especially if you live in the neighborhood.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'After walking around Buena Vista Park last night, we decided to explore the Haight and find a place for dinner. We had no set plan but decided to try someplace new.Came to Magnolia with high hopes! Prices seemed reasonable and although we weren\\'t planning on drinking, usually bars/ pubs have great food and warm service. We were seated quickly by the window and someone came over right away to check on us. So far so good, right? Unfortunately it was all downhill from there. We asked for water for our table and went ahead and ordered appetizers and our entrees.WE ALMOST DIED OF THIRST. Okay, I\\'m being dramatic but no waters to be had in this establishment and our server (sweet lady with backwards floral print hat) was MIA. She finally arrived with our appetizer (spicy wings) and said \"oh, I\\'ll bring you some water for the table.\" Yeah, thanks. I was willing to forgive the 10 minutes it took to get water since the food was pretty good. Not amazing food but my beau enjoyed the pub burger (it was cooked medium) and fries were crispy and delicious. I ordered the lamb sausage plate and also liked it--just a bit spicy with mash and greens/cabbage.Took a WHILE to have our plates cleared. In fact, it wasn\\'t our server that did it. I guess another server noticed how long we were waiting and took pity on us.When our prodigal server finally did come by, we naively asked for the dessert menu because we\\'re trusting folk and truly believed that the service could be redeemed.WE ALMOST DIED OF NO DESSERT. Okay, obviously not but it took another ten minutes of the MIA server just NOT bringing the dessert menu and us looking forlorn around the restaurant. Just as I was about to just walk up to the bar and pay, she magically appeared and asked if \"we needed anything.\" Are.You.serious.I said, we would like the check please and she said \"oh dessert!\" ... Nope, just the check.In my haste to GTFO of there, I of course left my credit card at the table. We walked about 10 minutes away and I called to see if they had it. They of course couldn\\'t find it and our server hadn\\'t seen it (much like she hadn\\'t seen us for the duration of our meal but I digress). I called my credit card company to cancel the card and OF COURSE magnolia calls back 30 min later to say they found it--Much like their service that night, a little late.My new card is in the mail and will arrive in 3-5 business days which seems lightening fast compared to the service here :/',\n",

       "  'review': \"This is probably my favorite brewery of all time. I don't go to the city too often but most of my trips include a stop to Magnolia for a couple pints of their killer beers and a bite to eat.The name Magnolia is a Grateful Dead reference so the music they play is usually very much dead or of similar influence. Most of the beers names have a dead influence as well. New Speedway Bitter, High Time Harvest... Seems appropriate as they are located in the Haight Ashbury district of the city.The beers are not only awesome but they serve them in 20oz. imperial pints! Beers are served cellar temperature and they always have a few cask conditioned offerings as well. My last visit I enjoyed the High Time Harvest Ale with fresh hops added to the beer within 24 hours of harvest, They had 2 versions, one with Citra hops, and the other with Mosaic. This is an awesome way to learn to identify what hop are in your beer by trying the exact beer brewed the same way but with a different single hop in each.For food you are sure to find something you love here. They pride themselves on sustainable and fresh local ingredients including humanly raised meets. They have an chef that has a very unique style. I would describe the place as a Gastropub. They usually have a couple house made sausage offerings, and a killer burger. I had their version of a pastrami dip that was served with french onion soup as the dip, so good!When I'm in the city I go to Magnolia, you should too!\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Whilst visiting Haight Ashbury my non-Yelp familiar husband took it upon himself to search for the best place to grab a bite that included good food and of course, good beer. \\xa0 Magnolia did not disappoint on either count. We ordered a few beers to start and I will be honest but, I cannot recall the name of the one other than the Landlady Best Bitter but, for us, that one was the showstopper. Coming from Vista and, our regularity at most nearby breweries I do believe it is high praise to claim that this was one of the best craft beers we'd ever ordered. We were off to a good start.I chose the fish and chips while the hubs ordered the Magnolia burger. Now, my husband eats burgers on a regular basis so for him to state that this was one of the top 5 he's ever had, is testament to how good this burger is. Given that I used to live in England, where some of the best fish and chips are to be had, I have to admit that I was surprised to find Magnolia could rival any that I've tasted in my second home. On top of that, our server Cece was an absolute delight. She was attentive, friendly, helpful and, just generally very personable and a real pleasure to have as a server.Overall this was a welcome respite to our day of hitting the tourist spots and definitely a place we would visit in the future.\",\n",

Someone else dropped off the eggs not noticing we had no silverware/ napkins and walked away in hurry, after waiting a few minutes we asked the host for silverware and she forgot about us too! Then the server came to ask how it was *still not noticing the obvious fact we had no utensils* so I had to ask aaaaagain. Sausage never came after sitting with empty plates and glasses for 20 minutes so I got up and asked for the check & guess what was on it... that damn sausage! Seems like no one gives a shit in the joint, very sad as the reviews seem to hype the place up. Don't get me wrong our server ruined most of it, could still be a cool joint.\",\n",

We were greeted by a friendly host, seated at a comfortable booth, and treated like we were family. We had the chicken sausage and cheese selection with assorted beers. The sausage was the best I've had in the city--just the right amount of spice! We also enjoyed the cheese--the grilled toast accompanying the cheese was perfect. Our server was slammed but she managed to keep our drinks full and stopped by frequently to see how we were doing. We stayed for about 2.5 hours and nobody seemed anxious to get rid of us to turn the table over. It was raining pretty hard so we decided to keep on drinking--why not? We had a great view of the street, so we also had plenty of entertainment. This place is well worth a stop!\",\n",

If you need something to nosh on, a great entree is their fish and chips with local cod. Super flaky, hot fish come on a giant bed of kennebec fries (which are just great on their own). Be warned that finding parking is impossible in this neighborhood, and once you've accomplished that, you will have to find a seat somewhere in this place.

They have a wide selection of house brewed and guest beers. My favorite is the rosebud, it's perfectly balanced and pairs well with their cheese plates. I haven't tried much of their food here, but everytime a table next to me gets their food, the smell is amazing. They do brunch, lunch, dinner and is open late. There are always people inside, but it's not crazy busy that you can't get a table. With small 2 tops, booths, a large communal table, and bar, it's great for groups or dates. Definitely, come check it out!\",\n",

       "  'review': 'My friends swear this is the best burger and the best pickles in San Francisco. I was looking forward to it. We were there early enough that we only had to wait about 10 minutes. We all immediately decided we wanted the Magnolia Pub Burger, which is the only burger they offer. The burger comes with lettuce, tomato, and onion. You pay to add cheese, you pay to add bacon, you pay to add egg. So my $14 plain burger ended up being $17 with the addition of gruyere and egg. It would have been $19 if I had gone for the bacon too, and $20 if I had chosen blue cheese over gruyere.We also ordered Scotch Quail Eggs to start. The eggs were good, served on top of a very spicy mustard sauce. But, quail eggs are tiny, so we were served two little eggs for $8.The burgers came out. All overcooked. The person who ordered it rare was served medium, and the others who ordered medium rare got well done. The burgers are also served dry and you have to add your own mayo/mustard/ketchup.I found the burger to be dry and lacking flavor. The egg was overcooked. The fries on the side were delicious. The pickle on the side (homemade) was great. Perhaps if the burger was cooked to my liking I would have enjoyed this place more, but $17 for a burger is still a bit too much for me. My pomegranate hard cider was good, and the guys enjoyed the beers they ordered.',\n",

The sausage was small and grainy and not very appetizing. The hashbrowns were potato wedges. There was a hearty serving of them - but they were barely seasoned, so they were repeatedly dipped into salt, ketchup and hot sauce. The mushroom was also fairly bland tasting.I enjoyed the company I was with, and the staff here were attentive, but I would not return to Magnolia's for breakfast or brunch. There are far too many quality eateries in the area with more extensive menus, cheaper prices, and with more flavorful food.Trust.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"4.5 STARS for the beer3 STARS for the food3.75 STARS OVERALLLet me preface this by saying I am in no way a beer connoisseur. Honestly, I don't know much about beer except I enjoy the occasional Blue moon with a meal. Once in a while when the mood strikes, I like the stronger beers like Guinness. Since I went on a Tues, it was $4 pints all day. Perfect excuse to try two beers instead of one! The Proving ground ipa and Stout of circumstance both appealed to the lighter and darker side of my tastes! Now on to the food. I found everything to be standard pub fair with more misses than hits.Plate of pickles: I enjoyed the pickled veggies, but the apple and kumquats were a little odd. The mix of sweet and pickle just didn't work for me.Half dozen oysters: Enjoyed the mignonette. Don't remember the type of oysters, but they tasted good with the all the sauces provided. Asked for tobasco and got a house hot sauce.Cheeses: They had run out of most of the cheeses I wanted so I got the Bad axe and Chimney. I normally like soft cheeses the most, but I really enjoyed the Bad axe. Nice, creamy and savory. Yum!Beer brined pork chop: Sooo salty! The brussels and sweet potato were nicely seasoned and the pork chop was nicely cooked, but it was way too salty. Ruined the whole dish.Pork & cheddar sausage: They had run out of the 2 sausages I wanted to try so we got this one instead. Everything was super oily. From the hash browns to the egg to the sausage. I love rich fatty food, but this dish needed some kind of carb or veggie to provide relief from all the oiliness of the ingredients in the dish.Fish and chips: Our waitress forgot to enter this dish in with our order so by the time we got it, I was super full! I took a bit of the fish and it was nice fried. So were the chips. But as far as the seasoning, etc, I can't really comment on that.So the only reason I came here was because I got a $100 gift card. If not for that, I probably would have never gone to Magnolia. Even though I would most likely never return for the food, I wouldn't mind coming here again for their $4 pints on Tues. Such a great deal!\",\n",

There was no seating at the bar so we sat down at a table after getting our drinks. A server came over and literally made us get off \"her table\" because it isn\\'t for bar service. We were forced to stand by the door and drink our beers while 3 tables remained unseated the whole time. I totally would have understood if she had a reservation or had people waiting to be seated but that was not the case. This server in particular didn\\'t show any care in the world and was just trying to make our day harder. Hopefully you guys get staff with a little more hospitality. Good luck in the future.',\n",

Service was s little bit fragmented, and they didn't notice what menu we were ordering off of, which was apparently the dinner menu, but they were only serving lunch/brunch, so we had to change our order, but other than that we had a great experience!We decided to split their French fries, and French toast, along with two of their beers. Their stout off the strong beer menu was fantastic, and actually a good breakfast beer, since it has that strong coffee flavor! The French fries were fresh, hot, and addicting. They have the skins still on them and are clearly made to order. We ate them all up! The apple French toast was also delectable. you get two fat pieces of bread, cut in half, with little apple chunks, whipped cream and syrup on them. Just delicious! Again, we left nothing of this as well.All the food that went by also looked great. I would definitely be back here if I lived in the area!\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Have been meaning to check out Magnolia for the longest time, both because I always walk by it and I've heard good things about their brews. I think I was always put off by the crowds, as they never seem to be not busy. But recently, my girlfriend and I ventured in one cold winter night. While the non-dinner area was full (they separate out the dining tables from the straight-up drinking area), people seem to come and go quickly and we grabbed some seats at a communal table.I was super excited to try the Proving Ground IPA, as I love me some hoppy beers and it was recommended on Untapped. This beer did not disappoint - certainly a winner if you are into IPAs. My girlfriend tried the Big Cypress Brown, at a more modest 3.7% ABV. While neither of us consider ourselves Brown Ale connoisseurs, it still went down well.As for the pub itself, I was really into the feel of it. Felt like a cross between a bar in PDX and London, style-wise. Of course, I always hope and wish for solid vegan pub food options, but that's just not a common occurrence in SF. Maybe one day..Anyway, I'm excited to take a walk back up to Magnolia in the near future and try some more.\",\n",

The only food I can comment on is the incredible curried mixed nuts which we re-upped on maybe three times in the course of an hour. Nom. Onto more important things - the beer was good! We tried a big mix of brews and most were delicious. Service was a little bit touch and go, but it was also starting to pick up when we arrived. Some servers seemed more comfortable discussing the beer list and making recommendations than others. Though the neighborhood can be grungy, this decor of this place is more industrial chic, and very clean. Big windows, indoor and outdoor seating, and it didn't feel too crammed. I'd like to come back to give the food a try!\",\n",

All of these were great reasons for me to return several times in my five day visit to SF.The pub is also beautiful, and inside you\\'ll find \"Ye Olde Pub\" atmosphere.

The indoor area was a mix of booths and community tables where multiple groups could sit. When we visited it was a Sunday afternoon and crowded.The beer selection pretty extensive and they had about two dozen on tap when we visited. I ordered a pale ale (pipers pale) and my Gf ordered a red (Sarah's med something...). Both were average tasting, and we both were not very impressed. However we saw several folks drinking and ordering multiple rounds so we assumed that the beers we ordered were just not to our liking.We would try this spot again, maybe order food too. Just an average 3 star experience when we visited this first time.\",\n",

Serendipitously strolling through the streets of San Fran, Magnolia caught my eye sheerly because \"Oh whoa a brewery just happens to be across the street. What is my life??!\". Came in, grabbed a pint, and kept on moving, but definitely worth a visit.The VenueDimly lit and filed with booths, they lean heavily on drawing crowds in for dinner service. I am fine with this and bet the food was great, but man does it sure steal the elbow room away from late-night patrons trying to wiggle their way to the bar. If you come here and get a meal/table you will probably have a better time than getting squished against your buddy at the slice of the place dedicated for bar service. \\xa0Pro Tip: they have bathrooms. They are not labeled and they are in the back so it kind of feels like you are walking into an employee only areaThe VibeThe energy here was great and they had a solid crowd Friday night. \\xa0The servers are hustling their way through the crowd so you will be more comfy when you have find a place to post up. Getting a drink was pretty easy, thank goodness, and the bar keep was swift and sweet when I closed out.The SudsDid not want to stick around too long so only tried my beer and my buds:Cask-conditioned Cole Porter: Under-carbonated for sure, even giving them leeway for the cask. Watery and pretty standard porter.Dry-hopped Spud Boys IPA: this was great! Had a light fruity, melon flavor that reminded me of summer. Totally wanted to drain my bud\\'s beer but manners I guess...Final ThoughtsOption 1: Go for dinner, get a meal, and enjoy yourself and your cozy space with a great vibe.Option 2: Go only for drinks, wade through everyone doing option 1, feel compelled to go for a \"one and done\" visit.',\n",

       "  'review': \"Having visited Magnolia twice, both as an out-of-towner, I can say the place bolsters a homely and modern gastropub vibe. With a small short menu and revolving beer selection, Magnolia is a hip place to be among locals and youthful twenty-somethings. To our fortune last Sunday, we came in around 1:30 p.m. and waited no longer than 10 minutes for a table/booth. Kelly served us intermittently, as she was quite busy handling (my guess) over half of this establishment. If I was a New Yorker, my patience would have been tested. This place needs probably 1-2 more servers/waiters during these hours. I ordered the fish and chips, and found it to be quite simple and delicious. The fish and chips were not too oily, and good in portion. The fries were plentiful. However, by the end of the meal, I was definitely feeling a bit sleep and full from the food. It didn't help to know that I was in a lazy Sunday mood. Many people love the beers here, and from my discussion with the patrons and from other yelpers, this is what keeps them coming back. Pricing is inflated to match SF city standards (a bit higher than what I'm used to being in LA) for such hip and cool joints. I encourage you to at least try this place if you're looking for a place to come with friends, but not the boss or someone you're trying to impress. It'll do you right, and leave you feeling comfy.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Stopped in with some friends for a beer and a quick bite. The place was very nice, reminded me of a classy English pub. It was a Sunday morning we visited and the place was quite packed, but we managed to get a table outside. Very cool that it was right on the sidewalk.The English pale ale I had was very delicious--its name escapes me. The beer menu was full of various English-style craft ales I would\\'ve liked to try more of if their food menu didn\\'t have an ounce of vegan options for my girlfriend and I to eat. You would think in a place like Haight they would have such offerings. I used to eat meat though, and for what options they did have they seemed very good. My girlfriend decided to finish our beers and eat elsewhere.I would\\'ve given this place another star, however while our server was quite nice, she took very long to return and check on us. What really ruined the experience for us, though, was another gal, raven-haired and slender, who was bussing the table behind us. I was politely trying to get her attention to request our check with our server a handful of times when she was literally right behind me. It seemed like she was blatantly ignoring me as it wasn\\'t very noisy outside. After my final call to her she finally responded with a rudely scold back to me \"My hands are full!\" It was very rude and unprofessional. And seeing the few glasses on her tray, she should\\'ve been very capable to take a minute to see to my needs, or at least given me the courtesy that they would be right with me.All in all, good beer and nice atmosphere; but the lack of vegan options and poor service is enough to keep me from coming here.',\n",

I have to say. I don't take this kind of raving lightly. Best damn fried chicken I've ever had. Hands down. Literally brought a tear to my eye.

We liked how the place looked from the outside and there was a good number of people inside enjoying drinks and food so we decided to go inside.The cool thing about this place is that they brew all of their beers. We asked for something light and was suggested the Kalifornia Kolsch - it was $4 and the cheapest on the board. It came in a pretty small glass but it was definitely enough (and delicious too!). I'd love love love to come back and try some of their other beers.As for food, I got the Smoked Pastrami Sandwich w/ Onion Soup ($15) - it was awesome but super greasy in a good way, and my hands were basically coated and glimmering with oil. It was basically the ultimate cheat treat. My mum ordered the Magnolia Burger ($15) - medium rare and was really good, but it wasn't my most memorable burger. My sister got the Roasted Portobello Burger ($17) which I didn't like because she got it with blue cheese (which I can't stand), but she was really impressed.Service was good with friendly people. The toilet was gender-neutral which may be surprising at first for some people but it was alright. Our check came around to $60 for all three of us. I'd love to come back for drinks when I'm in the area again.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'My wife and I have eaten and had beers at Magnolia many, many, times over the years. It was always one of our fav spots, since it was convenient from our house. I would have to say its kinda been a bit of a love/hate relationship. \\xa0We never had particular high expectations for the food, as it could be on the better or worse side, depending on the day. We have ordered everything from, soups, salads, burgers, pizza (back in the day) brick chicken, oysters, fried chicken, and quinoa hash, sausages, steak, fish.We could put up with the food, since we enjoyed the beer alot, favs; Proving Ground, Spuds Boy, Tweezer Triple, but the Cider is the worst swill ever according to my wife, and tasted like cardboard to me. Great people watching on the Haight & Masonic corner, and its used to be fun later in the evening when they turned up the music, and the beer was flowing.I think the beer and quality of the whole experience really went down hill prior to and after the opening of their sister restaurant Smokestack BBQ. The flavor of the beer was no longer the same, with a burnt toast flavor similar to Fat Tire. Their beers used to be some of my favs in the city, but sadly that is no longer the case.',\n",

Luckily a drink took of the edge and hunger.I probably should of tried the beer being that it was a brewery, but I didn't want to fill up on beer, so my friend and I got a brut champagne that we liked so much that we ordered another during our dinner. \\xa0She ordered a burger with gruyere cheese with fries (thumbs up), and I ordered the beer brined pork chop (generous in portion) with cheesy grits. \\xa0In anticipation of finally sinking my teeth into something, I was disappointed to find the pork chop was a little on the tough side and a lot on the salty side. \\xa0The cheesy grits were good, I just wish there was more. \\xa0Obviously this place attracts crowds, with nice staff, it's a lively spot and probably a decent place to stop in if there isn't a wait to have beer. \\xa0Based on an okay tasting dinner, price, and time, I couldn't say it was worth the wait.\",\n",

We were quickly upgraded to an inside seat and given water and silverware promptly. I know some other folks have had poor service here, but our service was just fine. Order: I got the pork belly and cheese grits. I've never liked grits, but these were mostly cheese with some grit consistency and super tasty. The pork belly was tender and the poached eggs oozing all over the grits just made for the perfect bite. My bf got the special of the day huevos rancheros, which he mostly finished - it was simple and decent but not blow-my-mind amazing. \\xa0I also got the pomegranate cider on tap which was tasty but my bf's beer was below par he said. Price: I think it came out to about $52 including tax/tip.Overall a 3.5 star meal plus a bump up for the good service that we did get.\",\n",

To drink I had their hard cider. Ironically it was more ABP% but my brother's oyster stout which had less ABP got me more buzzed. Anyway, food was super delicious.

We started with a glasses of wine and four different types of cheese with spicy grapes. The grapes gave a bit of tang to it. I had the Magnolia pub burger with an egg and gruyere cheese. You can add bacon, and other stuff on it, if you want. The burger was a good size. It was delicious. Magnolia creates its own garlic aioli and mustard. Add on condiments, if you would like them. It was just a perfect lunch. It was packed when we left. So, I'm guessing they fill up pretty quickly.\",\n",

I love your beer, your Dead theme, your decor, your house made condiments, especially the mustard and mayo, your desserts, your bathrooms with the cloth hand towels and your burger made me fall off the vegetarian wagon. I feel guilty about that, but it's the BEST BURGER IN SF....according to my husband. (I don't eat real burgers anywhere else) This brings me to my point, the only thing you are lacking, the only reason I can not give you 5 stars is because you have no veggie burger! Please Magnolia, try adding a veggie burger to the menu. The meat eaters will not resent you for it and the vegetarians will LOVE you for it.Your friend,Audra\",\n",

Pushing aside my portion of the bacon was easy, but what\\'s hard is realizing I never before have had the pleasure of eating grilled romaine lettuce. Now this is something I wish I could have as a side dish every night.Of course, the beer was great - that\\'s what you would expect, yes? That\\'s what we\\'ve come to expect.The only downside was how loud it was inside. My throat hurt after our dinner from trying to have a regular conversation across the table with my spouse.

The breading was a very light beer batter, they were placed over delicious shoestring fries with tatar sauce and cocktail sauce for dipping.

       "  'review': 'Stopped by here to meet up with some new/old friends, and it\\'s in a great area in the Haight St. There\\'s lots of nearby shops to check out if you\\'re in the area. We came for dinner, and we parked a few blocks away by the park. It was quite busy and packed when we got there. There isn\\'t a real clear \"check-in\" area so we walked around the pub in circles till we flagged down a waitress. It has such a cool European vibe to it. The beer is veryyy extensive, and so a few people in our group ordered some of the darker beers and IPA\\'s. We ordered the burgers, and the goat cheese salad. Great environment, and the coasters were so adorable - we had to keep it. I\\'d recommend this for groups, and those brisk nights.',\n",

       "  'review': \"Magnolia has changed a bit recently. The food is good but isn't as good as it used to be.The burger is now a 2 patty burger. It's decent but I prefer the previous burger. The new one is a touch greasier and isn't quite as juicy. They let you order it 'medium' but it has never come remotely pink the few times I've ordered it that way. Being that it's two thin patties, they take away that option as you can't cook a quarter pound patty to medium. Only medium rare or well. It's a bit disappointing.They've changed the fries as well and I prefer the previous ones. They are thicker and not as crispy.The burger plate now comes with a few pickle slices and no longer comes with a pickle slice... bummer.I heard that the fish and chips weren't as good also.Perhaps the changes all came with the recent news about the business, a new chef and a mostly new staff.I love the beer but paying $8 for one is a bit steep. They aren't *that* good.\",\n",

We had a casual get-together for a friend's birthday, and the staff made us feel like schoolchildren being in places we didn't belong. They would only let us move outside as our group got bigger if we made sure to order dinner, which we were going to, but it didn't feel good being reprimanded. (And they didn't even have two things off their menu - spicy lamb sausage and pastrami sandwich)We weren't rowdy or anything, but the service was slow so we had to keep going inside to order drinks from the bar after the food was served. We were obviously not wanted. Not recommended for large groups.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"My husband and I met a friend here, super excited to start trying out the brewpubs in our new home city. Love the neighborhood, everyone was friendly and communal. We went at 5:30pm on a Saturday, so perhaps there was a shift change or there were just not enough staff or something else, because the service was terrible. We waited for 10 minutes for someone to come clear the table we sat down at as it was being vacated by another party. I finally had to go to the bar, who then flagged down the server, who wasn't the right server but did clear off the table. Minutes ticked by, no service. My husband and I wrote down our flight choices and had them ready, so when the waitress did finally come by, we could pounce on her with our order. The flights came out promptly, but they messed up my husband's twice, giving him two of the same thing and leaving out one that he ordered. The beer was decent, but nothing to rave about. And we tried 12 different pours between the two of our flights. We ordered some pickled vegetables, the corn tartine with burrata, and marinated local squid. They were all fine, but nothing to come back for.I know that this is an iconic location and all, but I don't think we'd go back because of the service and the mediocre food and beer.\",\n",

Also, they consistently have multiple cask beers ready to enjoy, and though I am not a big cask guy, Magnolia tends to understand what kind of beer belongs in a cask. Always a good choice. The service is always spot on, though because it's busy sometime you may have to wait a few to be seated. But service is ALWAYS stellar.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I love beer and I love pub food, so I want to love Magnolia, but I just can't. It's located in a great space in the Haight. Warm wood tones and friendly staff. The food, however, is quite expensive for the portions. Recently, my boyfriend and I stopped by for lunch. We got an order of the Devils on Horseback, which are bacon wrapped dates stuffed with goat cheese. I thought $6 seems reasonable for an appetizer, until it came out and there were only two of them on the plate.Then I ordered the crispy chicken drumsticks for $9 and three came out on the plate. My boyfriend ordered the hamburger with cheddar - $15. He said he liked it okay, but to me it tasted the same as any other normal hamburger and the fries that came with it were all stubby and short, as if they had served us the dredges of the fries pile.So, while the food is good here, there are just so many other places to eat in the area that are better value for the money. I guess I will just limit my visits to Tuesdays when pints are only $4. That's a deal I can get behind!\",\n",

So that wasn't very welcoming. Food: I've had better especially for their prices, I got the shrimp sandwich. it was kinda soggy. I'm not sure if it was just sitting in the back, because it was also very cold. Beer: Probably the best thing going for this place, wide variety of different beers. But our server told us it's more focused on English beer? So it was different than most beers I usually drink. I think the next time if I'm every in the area and decide to come here, I'll just keep it at getting a beer.\",\n",

Or sweet potato fries. Can't really go wrong with either. Or the beer. Had a pumpkin.... stout I believe.... goodness... way to ring in October.Customer service is also notable.\",\n",

Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the beers, how they're made, what they'd pair well with, etc.We ordered the popcorn appetizer. Twice. It was that good. There was a good mix of salads and sandwiches and entrees around the table, and we all enjoyed our meals. A solid choice in Haight.\",\n",

The brunch menu at first glance doesn't look exceptionally amazing, but after eating it that first impression is very wrong. The food is fresh and the ingredients are great. The Croque Madame was awesome (the potatoes that come with are super crispy and good too) and the Quinoa Hash was so delicious (great vegetarian option). They even give you a side of homemade hot sauce! Most importantly, the mimosas are HUGE and made with fresh squeezed juice. Truly one of the best I've had. Great service too. Can't wait to try it for dinner sometime.\",\n",

I would have loved to sit outside because the weather was gor-geous! The inside was nice too, dark furnishings but lots of mirrors and windows for natural light! My friend and I are both of the same mindset of splitting meals since we don't have big appetites, so I was happy to split their Magnolia burger and fries with her! While the burger was juicy and delicious, it wasn't my favorite. A good quality burger but nothing to write home about. We did however LOVE the pomegranate hard cider they have. MUST DRINK IF YOURE INTO CIDER! It's not too too sweet and is a little dry. Perfect complement to the nice weather outside.Service was mediocre, our waiter was nice enough but wasn't around when we wanted to order drinks after we had already ordered food.All in all, a nice place to eat/drink in the Haight and a respite from the gutter kids and hobos.\",\n",

It's funny I can't remember what the heck I ordered oddly enough, but that my brother got the fish and chips here, which was good, but not quite as great as my fav fish fry spots back home in Chicago(i.e. Edgewater Lounge). Beers were fine enough that myself and my brother got, and the service was fine considering how crowded it was when we came. Luckily the wait wasn't too bad to get in, only something like 15-20 minutes.I wouldn't be against coming back if someone else I was with wanted to return, and if the wait wasn't too insane to get in.

At first I was a little disappointed that we could not sit at the tables outside because they don't allow alcohol outdoors. We also could not sit at the booth seating, which was limited to customers who order food. Luckily, there was a friendly group of people at the bar tables who shifted their stools to make room for us.Now to the beer. Earlier that day they had just tapped a line of beers to celebrate strong beer month, so I was very excited. Here is a summary:Most enjoyable: Promised Land Imperial IPAMost herbal flavor: Quadlibet for TenderfeetBest name: Old Thunderpussy BarleywineIf you plan on trying several beers, remember to get a punch card.

My friend and I were the first to arrive in our party, we were expecting a few others to show. The waitress sat my friend and me at one of their large booths and said \"no one else can sit here, once you 2 have been seated\". I really just shrugged her comment off since the booth was huge and could easily accommodate 4 people. Well when my friend and his wife arrived I go to skooch over to make space for the 2 of them and the waitress tells us that my friends are not allowed to sit with us and must wait to be seated at their own table! Really, it\\'s their restaurants policy.. In ALL of my years of dining experience I\\'ve never ever heard of such a stupid rule... Not wanting to make a big deal of it we ended up getting up from our table and moving over to a new table to sit with them a few steps away.. How this makes any sense is beyond me, but no worries, none of us plan to return.PS: They only have like 5 items on the entire menu with only 1 of them being vegetarian/vegan.',\n",

       "  'review': \"I remember back when I only ordered beers that I was familiar with, ones that tasted like or looked like other beers I had before. Ever since I broke out of that shell and started sampling different brews, I have really developed a love for beer. For Father's day, I came to the Magnolia Brewery with my Dad and some friends for beer and a bite to eat. We had been talking about good beer, so I decided to try a sampler. Although not printed on any menu, they will give you 6- 4oz. samples of any beer you choose. I won't bore you with my opinion of each beer, but I'm a fan of the Proving Ground IPA, Ruby Mild (Dark) or Billy Sunday. (See yelp.com/biz_photos/tdPI…)To start we had the Devils on Horseback, blue cheese stuffed dates that are wrapped in bacon and broiled so that everything melts just perfectly together. Very Savory. We also ordered the plate of pickles, that did not contain any pickles - but pickled beans, carrots and such. For our meals, some of us split sandwiches and burgers with fries- which was a perfect amount of food. The Prather Ranch Burger was a hit and so was the Fried Chicken Sandwich, the fries were okay but not crisp. They were really nice about plating them up for everyone and splitting the fries.The food was excellent, we all were really happy with our selections and had fun sampling each others meals and beers. Now I know exactly what I want next time, two of everything. :P\",\n",

A bit on the pricey side, but the food is good pub fare. Their homemade mustard is fantastic.The other great part of Magnolia is the vibe. It has a proper pub feel to it. You can sit down, sip on your pint, and enjoy a chat without feeling rushed by major crowds or insanely loud music. Even when it is \\xa0busy, it doesn't feel overwhelming like most dive bars in the city.Cheers!\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I visit Magnolia for one reason and one reason only: Two Rivers Pomegranate Cider. Have you ever tried this stuff? It's tart, sweet and goes down like a soda pop. Warning: don't drink more than 1-2 of these in an evening, though, as it will give you a tummy ache. The kind you would get if you drank an entire gallon of apple juice... catch my drift?Magnolia is a great bar in the Haight. Definitely a respite from the grimy gutter kids and dirty streets. Inside is reminiscent of a depression-era diner, with old-timey barstools and tall booths. Love the vintage mirrors on the walls too. Food is OK, but it's the drinks here that are worth return visits. They also offer other great local beers on tap as well as a decent wine list.When I'm in the neighborhood visiting friends, Magnolia is my #1 spot.\",\n",

Disclaimer: I've only been for brunch and lunch, but I've eaten my way through most of the menu and, wow, please do not sleep on the pork belly and grits. Please don't. The quinoa hash and hangtown fry are equally incredible. The portions are perfect-sized; if you're moderately hungry you'll probably have some leftover. Most brunch entrees hover around $15 (which i think is perfectly reasonable anywhere in the city), and they serve blue bottle coffee in a charming aluminum french press. The atmosphere is reminiscent of a 1920's era pub; hexagonal checkered tile floor, lots of heavy wood furniture and mirrors. Great natural light in the morning makes for a quaint and leisurely brunch. Grab a window seat for prime Haight street people watching.\",\n",

We were going to order food so we sat down at a table - but then she proceeded to circle the restaurant, every time going by us and giving us an evil eye. It was very odd. The beer was good, the food was so-so. We split a small plate of wings and the house-made pickles. The pickles were fine; I've had better. The wings were not good. The were overly coated in sauce - it looked like it had just been dumped on. We may be back (???) because we live nearby and the beer was good, but more likely not.\",\n",

If you're a dive bar kind of person, come through here.They got extremely good beer on draft, the service is good, and the way the restaurant is set up is ergonomic.I especially like when pubs have a chalkboard of what brews are available. I like it more when they cross out ones that are out. It sort of just signifies that they're on top of their game and are serious about their product.The atmosphere was inviting and the crowd of people seemed cool. My friend and I just had a beer and good conversation for about an hour and went about our business. I ordered some fries that were pretty good. I wouldn't mind trying the other food here sometime.This is a spot to stop by for sure if you're just wandering around Haight looking for something to do. I usually prefer the bars in Lower Haight but this rekindled my interest in Upper Haight. Lower Haight is usually devoid of all the young shoppers.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"This was the one meal we had in San Francisco during a recent vacation that wasn't worth our time. We decided to come here on a whim on an afternoon when we were both feeling a little under the weather. We were staying a few blocks away on Page St. so this was a convenient option while we explored Haight-Ashbury area. I guess it served its purpose. The food, though, just wasn't that good. I got a burger, which was $17 after adding cheese and bacon. I'm from Washington, D.C. so overpaying for a hamburger is something I regrettably do quite a bit. If you like a good hamburger and enjoy eating out, it's just unavoidable and I get that San Francisco ain't cheap, either. But if I'm shelling out that kind of money for a friggin burger, it better at least be good. What I got here was awful--well-done, even though I had ordered it rare, and I think I remember some sort of sauce that came on it that I could have done without. I would have sent it back but we were in a hurry. They were also out of tea, which sick little me was pretty bummed about. On the positive side, the Scotch quail eggs that we ordered as an appetizer were great. We were also able to sit outside on really nice day. Although it took a while to order, our food came out pretty quickly and the service was friendly. Bottom line: San Francisco has so many good restaurants from just about every price point imaginable. Especially if you're on vacation with a limited amount of time, this place just isn't worth it.\",\n",

This could not be the day I spent $8 on the driest pulled chicken sandwich I've ever had in my life and a $7 snow cone. Instead, today was the day I went to Magnolia for the first time in 6-years. I definitely have to say I was more impressed with Alembic, and I know they're not the same. However, what do I expect when I ordered a burger? No more Niman Ranch beef the industry is using, it's passe, now they're using Prather Ranch. Either way, the beef is good. The burger was so damn juicy it jizzed on my chin when I bit into it. House cut fries have a certain charismatic character, lending themselves as crunchy (and some not crunchy from the non-uniformity) and salty bites. $13And let's just admit their beers are superior. I mean, how many other places in the city do they have amazing beers on cask? Like a handful?Try the Cole Porter house beer, I did. Lighter than a stout with a backdrop of peet smoke, $6. But, if you come on happy hour on wednesdays, they're half off. Or, dish out the $6 and come on thursdays for their fried chicken.\",\n",

The Pork and Cheddar Sausage was aMAZing, with a lot of the work done by a perfectly paired super crispy potato pancake and sour cream. \\xa0 Also, their burger is fantastic here, though to be fair the only time I had it I was not paying close attention because I had just \"finished\" B2B.I\\'ve also had some other things here, some better than others. \\xa0Commence completely disorganized paragraph following reasonable topic sentence. \\xa0The Proving Ground IPA proves indeed that it is possible to score 100 bitterness units.

       "  'review': \"After hearing positive reviews, we decided to stop by on a week night. What struck me was how nice the customers are. As we stood at the bar to order our beers, people happily moved out of the way so we can order in peace; love the consideration and awareness. Returned today as it was a beautiful warm sunny day, perfect for outdoor brunch. Unfortunately, we were advised that no liquor is served outdoors due to a permit issue so we sat inside. Solid, easy service and our food arrived promptly. The hangover fry was delicious (altho I didn't have a hangover) and enjoyed the caramelized onion and bacon combination on the eggs. The oysters were lightly fried so that I tasted the oysters. There is a homemade hot sauce which isn't too spicy or sour, but had the right amount of sweetness to it which we promptly used on everything on our plate.My favorite beer right now is the Chocolate George Stout (5.6% alcohol which is on the lower end of typical stouts) and tastes like liquid dark chocolate; perfect to savor slowly. The bathroom is a bit of a conundrum and I observed a guy trying to open the wrong door. I won't reveal the secret behind it so you'll have to stop by and check it for yourself. Overall, a good place to catch up with friends and enjoy another perfect sunny SF day.\",\n",

They'd rather organize newspapers instead of pour me a beer. I waited 15 minutes, more or less, at an empty bar until I got to talk to someone. I asked if they do flights and he suggested pints since it was $4 Tuesday. \\xa0I found that helpful since I wanted to try a kask and I didn't want to pick out 6 beers when most all of them are bitters and IPAs.Excited to try kask drawn beer so I ordered Saras Ruby Mild. (Only 3.4ish % abv, I love the big beers but you gotta have your small ones too). It was very good and I like the slightly warmer temp and little to no carbonation of kask style. Food came out fast. You can peak in the kitchen window from the bar and it looked like they were working hard. \\xa0Pork Shoulder Sandwich was excellent and spicy mixed green side salad was perfectly dressed. I will be coming back, great food, great beers, I just hope I don't get ignored like I did the first time I went.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Magnolia is a small gastropub nestled in the unique and eclectic Haight/Ashbury. After passing by this place so many times on the bus on the way to other eateries in the Upper Haight, we decided to finally stop in for a late lunch.Magnolia's has a very cozy, neighborhood, atmosphere and is a nice spot to grab some drinks and some food and catch up with friends. My boyfriend and I really liked the ambiance and the overall decor of the place.The menu had pretty standard pub food and we opted for the fish and chips. I've usually had cod when I order fish and chips, but at Magnolia's they use flounder. The fish was great and it was even better when paired with the tartar sauce, which had a ton of lemon flavor. The fries were amazing! We were also given a garlic aioli dipping sauce that was pretty tasty. The only complaint I have is that for the price of the fish and chips, $16, I wish they gave you more than two pieces. Magnolia's is one of the better places to grab a bite on Haight so you can't go wrong with stopping by here. I definitely want to come back and try something else off their menu and also one of their many beers (which they brew onsite!).\",\n",

Even after we sat for 20 minutes trying to make eye contact with anyone who could bring us a beer. One member of our party of four had already been served. I guess they thought the three of us just wanted to sit and chat on a Friday afternoon after work. We almost left at one point but didn't want our friend to chug her over priced cider. We finally got our order taken but no one seemed concerned with asking if we wanted a second round or anything else. It then literally took 30 mins to get the bill after asking two different people. We almost walked out but figured that would be the only time anyone paid any attention to us. Some people might think that the brewery was busy. It wasn't! Not even remotely crowded.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Solid brunch spot on the always busy Haight Street, where you are guaranteed a wait for a seat, a good pint of beer and an excellent meal. When we got to MAGNOLIA PUB & BREWERY at 12:45pm on a Saturday, there was understandably a wait, we put our name in and the Hostess said \"it would be about 20 minutes\". After about 25 minutes, we asked the Hostess again and she said \"well, it would be about 20 minutes\"... okay. Someone else from our party went in to ask about the wait and a different Host (I think he was the manager) said it would be about 5 minutes and sure enough, we were seated in under 10 minutes. I have to admit, as we were walking to our table, I heard the original hostess tell another customer that the wait would be \"about 20 minutes\" - ha!MAGNOLIA is hopping, a very lively joint with good energy, a strong bar and a nice looking room - it\\'s easy to see why their place is so popular. They are known for their beers and their \"Chocolate Stout\" did not disappoint but we were here for Brunch so on with the food. The meal for the four of us consisted of a SCOTT EGG (covered in sausage and served with a spicy/smokey Romesco Sauce), FRENCH TOAST (great cinnamon bread covered in roasted pears and bourbon whipped cream), CHICKEN HASH (a massive pancake of hash covered with two eggs and pancetta strips, surrounded by salmorejo sauce) and the BBQ BELLY & GRITS (slow-cooked BBQ Pork Belly in a sea of Anson Mills cheddar grits, topped with a poached egg & fried shallots!While I am usually a \"savory\" person, the Cinnamon French Toast was an absolute knock-out, a feast for the tastebuds but very decadent as one friend said \"it\\'s good but its too much like dessert\". The Chicken Hash was great and the addition of crispy pancetta always makes anything taste better. While the Pork Belly itself was tender and flavorful, I found the grits to be somewhat flavorless with extremely little to no cheddar taste at all. Finally, the Scotch Egg was good but only one for $8? I found it too expensive for what you got.I will go back to MAGNOLIA, it\\'s a good space with decent service and an original brunch menu worth having again. Keep tabs on your wait times and you should be good to go.',\n",

       "  'review': 'For a place in the Haight that is insanely overcrowded on Friday and Saturday nights? This joint was actually pretty good. Would I ever call my non-Tuesday experience \"homey\" or \"neighborhood\"? No... it definitely felt like the Grateful Dead were playing music over a trendy night-time hangout -- Jerry would have need to been out of his mind to handle the hustle and bustle. That was odd and disheartening for someone who grew up listening to his father talk about the neighborhood he was born in.That said, I did enjoy my pomegranate cider way more than I thought, and my partner\\'s chicken breast was actually a juicy half a chicken, flavored mildly but quite nicely, with garnish. Good! In comparison however, my \"steak\" was more like the slices off someone else\\'s steak... the same price on the item, but vastly different portion sizes. Why would you do that? Just make me pay more for the steak or cut down her portion and make it cheaper, because there was no way she was eating that chicken on her own. My steak was also ordered medium rare, and I ended up with a nearly-raw piece of steak with some ugly unrendered tendon in the middle. It was edible, and had a solid jus underneath it... but that plus the 2 tiny potatoes and the oh-so-\"I learned this on Top Chef\" broccolini made this plate not worth the price at all. My British friend and his companion both said the fish and chips were just good... nothing really amazing. Want to drink craft beer and be seen by other people who drink craft beer? Want to pretend the Haight isn\\'t a dirty place? Magnolia will suit you nicely. I\\'d go back... I\\'m just in no rush to do so.How is the average price range $11-30 as listed on yelp, but their cheapest entree (the burger) is $16? To make it under $30 you\\'d have to have a cheap beer and the cheapest app. Either folks are basing their prices on just drinking, or aren\\'t paying attention to Yelp pricing rules. Average? This is a $$$ place.',\n",

I have had the roasted chicken, burger, ahi and some appetizers and am always happy with the portions, quality and originality. The service is also good and the space itself is very welcoming and warm, including the layout with a great balance of small tables, large tables, bar, bar tables and outdoor area. In San Francisco, this kind of layout is rare.Unfortunately, they lose major points for the noise level. I am shocked by how loud they insist on having the music, especially for breakfast. It's so bad that I won't go there anymore, and will choose the mediocre People's Cafe down the street or the perpetually crowded and less delicious Pork Store over Magnolia any day of the week. Which is a damn shame, because Magnolia offers something on Upper Haight that is unique and rare with its gastropub fare and good beer.\",\n",

The first 3 beers I tried to order were either sold out or out of season--time to update your menu, guys. The 2 beers I did try were good; the IPA was pleasantly hoppy without being overbearing, but the quadrupel wasn't as flavorful as some I've had. Foodwise, the Devils on Horseback appetizer--goat-cheese stuffed dates wrapped in bacon--was tasty if a little too sweet, and at $6 for 2 seem overpriced. The burger was actually excellent! It's tough to balance juicy with the need to hold the burger together, and these guys nailed it. Desert, on the other hand, was pretty forgettable, though their espresso is top-class.Overall damage $50+tip for 3 courses, 2 beers and an espresso.

       "  'review': \"I've been to a few brew-pubs in my day, all across the spectrum. Some great, some not really worth a return. And then there are the ones I go out of my way to visit. Magnolia falls into that category for me.It's much smaller and less in-your-face than many other brew pubs, but that's also all part of the charm and experience that you're signing up for.Located in the historically counter-culture hub of the city, you expect some level of funk going on here. In truth, it more resembles a traditional Irish pub than it does an acid trip. Let's talk beer. So I've been here on two different trips into the city. The first was after getting good recommendations and the second was an intentional hike into the city from a work trip in San Jose, for quality beer and food. The beer will not let you down. They tend to have mostly English style ales, but there are always a few surprises on tap. Their range of IPAs are great, as are their varied bitters, a type that seems a lot of breweries don't really dive into. On my last trip, I definitely was that strange dude. Sitting at the bustling bar alone, I bellied up, not caring, and ready to have a memorable meal. And I did just that.I started with an IPA, then decided to get my taste buds going with a cheese plate of local California cheese (when in Rome, right?) Then as my second beer was arriving, I went all in and went for the fish and chips. As much as I wanted to pretend I was going to get a healthier option, seeing that golden brown delicious planks of fish being served to the guy next to me just broke me. So I gave in and enjoyed every last bite. For being a small place, it can get really, really jammed really fast. But, be patient grasshopper, and it'll be worth your wait. The bartenders are pretty efficient and quick and can find a hole in the crowd to serve you.As I write this, as happy hour draws nearer, I just wish I was en route to Magnolia right now.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'The beer is good. I\\'ve been an all grain amateur brewer for 17 years, and know a little about beer. I tried both the draught and cask bitters, and liked both. Did I say the beer is good?First time there was eleven days ago. Had two bitters, one draught, the other cask, fish and chips. Wish the \"chips\" were more like the thick cut (i.e. 5/8 inch) British pub style. For a place doing British style ales, could be more authentic. Their\\'s here are more like MacDonald\\'s fries, but not as tasty. The place is somewhat crowded and noisy. I managed to get a stool at the bar; I was alone. Not a place for an extended conversation, but perhaps to enjoy an ale with someone who appreciates a good craft brew. Overall, I liked the atmosphere, and the service was good.That first visit, I was impressed with the fish. Wasn\\'t cod, but the flounder was two pieces of a good size, crusty on the outside and flaky on the inside. I enjoyed this visit and anticipated when I might return. Had a British friend visiting last week, and was disappointed we couldn\\'t get there.Then, today, I managed a couple hours, after lunch (to miss the crowd). Ordered a cask conditioned bitter, fish and chips. The ale was as good as I remembered; the chips the same, but I could live with them. I was disappointed with the fish; still two long pieces, looked smaller than eleven days ago, not as crusty on the outside, not flaky (sort of mushy) on the inside. Didn\\'t enjoy them anything like before.I hope today was a fluke. I\\'d expect more consistency. I\\'d have given them a five after my first visit; but based on today, it is more like a three. I\\'ll probably try again; I\\'d like more consistency, and something like my first experience. One can hope. But, the beer is good!',\n",

The fish and chips could be a little bland, but the burger is definitely one of the top in the city. Quick note on that though: if you come for brunch/lunch, the burger is one patty. If you come for dinner, it's two! The side salad is nice but I usually got the fries which were MUCH better to eat while they were warm. Definitely try the Scotch eggs appetizer! One of my faves.The Kalifornia Kolsch was our favorite beer, but the pomegranate cider was pretty tasty! Out of respect for the drought and water shortage, like a lot of other restaurants in the city, they only serve water if you ask.Their service wasn't always amazing, but was more consistently decent than not.\",\n",

Great beer, great food, and great ambiance. We got there early for brunch, and we managed to get a seat at the bar. As a result, our service was fantastic. I ordered the croque madame. It was cooked perfectly, and there were potatoes on the side that were just right (I\\'m very picky about my potatoes). My mimosa had freshly squeezed orange juice, and the beer was excellent (the porter on cask).If you like to visit gastropubs, you should visit Magnolia.She Said\\'s Potty Points: Magnolia has the best potty situation I\\'ve found in San Francisco. Somehow, their restrooms are always clean even though they are unisex. I like the fact that the bathrooms are their own rooms--no stalls. Five out of five potty points!',\n",

It was darker - creamy and kind of sweet. Very good. I also ordered the \"special\", which was a breaded pork sandwich. The sandwich was not very good in my opinion. Dry and not much flavor.

       "  'review': '\"OMG! you\\'re drinking beer?!\" bestie looks around at the bar and then back at me again. \"Who are you?!?\"I\\'m standing while chugging (yes, chugging) Blue Bell Bitter from the tap, it\\'s 4.5% alc, pale amber color and might I say.....delicious? YES.\"She\\'s in there somewhere! but can we go to a bar later?\" (Gin&Tonic is silently screaming in its head and asking me the same question you just asked me 5 mins ago!)Magnolia Pub is KNOWN for their Blue Bell Bitter. And their Cole Porter. And their Proving Grounds IPA. There\\'s a brewery on site and some of their other beers come from all over the bay area. They serve gastropub fare here. It\\'s run of the mill and I feel that the apps are overpriced. Devils on the horseback? good. Goat cheese stuffed dates wrapped in bacon! who doesn\\'t love anything wrapped in bacon anyway!? but two tiny pieces aren\\'t worth $6.I love charcuterie. We sampled their Sopressatta. Thinly sliced, dotted with fat, salty. It was good. Perfect with the kumquats and pickled garlic. We requested the grass fed Prather Ranch burger to be cooked medium. It was presented almost well done, but at least not dry. Well seasoned beef but I didn\\'t care for the fries. Service could use some improvement. Also, it\\'s fairly loud in here and the pew-like booths can be cramped so prepare to eavesdrop on your neighbor\\'s convo. The best seats in the house are at the communal table which provides a direct line of vision of Haight and Masonic sts. If the mood for beer strikes again (aka: once in a blue moon) I\\'d consider Magnolia Pub for a pint. For food, you\\'re better off at Escape from New York Pizza two blocks away.',\n",

I'm not going to describe my personal 4 experiences because, frankly, you don't want to read another rant. \\xa0This review is the combined experiences of myself AND all my friends and a multitude of other people.I have a strict rule to always rate the restaurant on food, never on service. \\xa0It is unfair to give a bad rating based on a server who is having a bad day.However, this is an exception to the rule.Unfortunately, the service is consistently SO bad that it makes eating at this restaurant actually unbearable. \\xa0The hostess and all the servers have the most uncaring and unenthusiastic attitude I have ever encountered. The fact that there are dozens of reviews such as this - and \\xa0the restaurant owners do nothing to comment or change anything - is the reason this place gets 2 stars.This restaurant is still going strong is because it has the best location in Haight and stands out in its beer selection. \\xa0Congratulations on a great business decision, its just such shame the owners couldn't care less.As someone who used to be a server for several years, I recommend that if you have bad service - tip appropriately. \\xa0It is the only way to change the way you're served on next time. \\xa0Don't be scared. \\xa0They WILL take notice.\",\n",

First time here and there is a hipster vibe to the other customers that I don't recall seeing around haight street but it's been a while and things change. Pros, IPA was good and strong flavored, some nice looking young single ladies looking to get some drinks bought for them, and laid back atmosphere for good conversations. Convenient hooks under bar for coats and attentive bar tender. Cons drink selection might not be to everyone's tastes since there are some who don't enjoy beer and there was one pomegranate cider but not that sweet. Young crowd, nice to look at but mostly just made me feel old and not hippster enough. It's a bit sad to see a guy dressed in a disco ball jacket stand out so much in a SF bar. Just not quite my scene but was fun to check out since I've gone past the place so many times.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I have been here many times and thoroughly enjoyed the food and the many interesting beers. Last night, I knew I was in for trouble when it took forever to get someone\\'s attention at the bar. There were the three servers, all gathered at the food pick-up station, goofing around and having their own little party. OK, I\\'ve seen this before at other places, so I\\'ll just be patient. Finally, one of the guys takes my beer order, but continues his silliness with his female co-worker. He\\'s holding onto my beer while chatting and giggling with her, while scratching his beard and hair, with my beer in hand. Dude, what is keeping you from just handing my the drink? Why must you continue to chat and play around while I stand there? Normally you\\'ll see this at a grocery store, when the clerk stops midway through ringing you up to chat to the co-worker...you\\'re standing there thinking, \"am I invisible here?\". At this point I just walked out. Obviously it\\'s more important to continue the silly conversation with the co-worker than to take care of the customers!Normally, a great place. To the manager:I\\'m sure you don\\'t like seeing money walk out your door. Please advise the staff that this is a BUSINESS, and not their own little party spot.Just to clarify: This was on Thursday night, Feb. 28th. around 11pm or so.Thanks to the manager for a nice response regarding the issue.',\n",

While having a nice conversation we were interrupted by another waiter who said we had to leave the table because it was needed for someone who was going to order food. He said there were seats at the bar. So we weren't happy but we agreed and went inside only to see a bar with no empty seats. Asked the waiter where are these empty seats he said well you can go stand over in the corner. Thanks alot! If we had stayed at the table we would have been done in five minutes anyway. Anyway, I just think that's a poor way to treat paying customers. We will not go back.\",\n",

We settle on a couple of drafts that turn out great.We order some of the sausages and, upon arrival, are treated to some of the most delicious tasting sausages ever. Friends order burgers which are gone in a matter of moments. A great time with great service makes for a great stop. Thank you!',\n",

Also notable were the devils on horseback - the goat cheese stuffed dates wrapped in bacon. Really incredible, but for the price, I would have expected three or four of them on the plate rather than just two. The decor is neat, with big windows to admire the outside.

They have a decent selection of beer and several IPAs but I usually like a little lighter and less hoppy (kind of a wimp!). The beer was good, but fairly warm, which kind of sucked but still tasty. My friend I and split the fried green tomato sandwich, which was AMAZING! It is served with arugula and grilled onions (and I think pancetta too, but we are both vegetarians so we did without). The tomato wasn't greasy at all and it was so damn tasty I literally told people about it later. The fries were good, too. For the sake of rounding the review out, I'll briefly comment on the service. Our server was really nice and attentive. It took a little long to get the second beer I ordered, but I could tell he was busy. We got water within minutes of being seated and our server was nice and professional. My only other note: If you're not in the mood for beer, the pomegranate cider is sweet and crisp.\",\n",

Their IPA is also very solid -- hoppy without destroying your tastebuds (at least initially, but the IBUs are pretty high so I wouldn't recommend trying any other beers if you start out with the IPA). I loved their triangle holder for their beer samples ($10 for 6 samples). Initially, I thought $10 for 6 samples was kind of a rip off, but the samples are decently large, and you can choose any six.The french fries smelled delicious, and I felt regretful that I didn't get any.I'm usually terrible about providing pictures with my Yelp review, but this time I thought I would take the extra effort:Triangle beer sampler holder: yelp.com/biz_photos/tdPI…Card that accompanies the beer sampler: yelp.com/biz_photos/tdPI…\",\n",

The atmosphere is classic with old mercury mirrors, upbeat music playing in the background, a large community table, lots of seating and a few tables outside. Wherever you sit there is a view of the historic Haight Street and crowds of interesting people walking and/or hanging out nearby. The beer is excellent at Magnolia's! I had their Stout and the rest of our party had the IPA. Next time, I would like to try their flight of beers. The food was excellent! We all had burgers with salad and everyone finished their plate. The service was excellent, from the hostess, to our servers to the bartender. Everyone was professional, accommodating, friendly and we did not have to wait for a second round of beer. I also appreciated how accommodating and accepting the staff was regarding my little one asleep in the stroller. My family and I will definitely return to Magnolia Pub & Brewery next time we are in SF near Golden Gate Park.\",\n",

I am a big fan of brew pubs and was pleasantly surprised by their beers. Good quality beers....not too expensive. A beer for everone's individual tastes. Barleywine was delicious. IPA selection was huge (even offered other SF brewerys).Our bartender was nice enough to let us try a smidge of a beer before we committed to a pint. Whenever a bar does this, it makes me happy as it is a sure sign that the establishment wasnts to ensure that you have the best drinking exerience at their place.OKAY -- the beer is good --- BUT BUT BUT..........The sausages are the highlight of this place. Being from NYC, we have a ton of German beer gardens that offer sausages. Magnolia has topped them thus far (except for Kristov in Brooklyn but I think it is closed). Try the Linguisa. This is a heavenly sausage.Service was good. They were extremely busy but all really happy. The sign of a good establishment.Drink, eat sausage, and be merry. MY WIFE AND I WERE :+)\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Dropped in for a late weekend lunch on a sunny day during SF Beer week. Since it was later in the day we scored a table with no wait. We opted for the sampler as we usually do at a brewery we are unfamiliar with. Surprisingly, instead of a \"not bad, don\\'t like that one, that one is good, ew what is this\" I went thru the options with hardly any I disliked. This stood out to us since we visit a lot of breweries. It was strong beer month so our sampler was guided by that. He loved the Rye Rye Rocco and I enjoyed the Pride of Branthill. Great flavors all around. Met some nice folks sitting next to us an struck up a convo. It was such a fun, friendly atmosphere.Our waitress was great and mindful of the order of food since we were sharing most dishes. My husband, who eats the four-leggers, enjoyed the pork nuggets. I enjoyed the clams. The seafood sausage, while spicy was also quite tasty. The spinach salad with the butternut squash was absolutely delish. I never say salad is delish.Thanks Magnolia for an awesome lunch date. We\\'ll be back.',\n",

       "  'review': \"In the heart of Haight-Ashbury, nestled between apparel merchants and a Ben and Jerry's, Magnolia offers pub fare slightly elevated. A rustic feel is handed to you by the leather and wood interior, dish towels, for napkins, that your mother probably owned, and the well-worn tiles that may have been installed 100 years ago. Started with a sparkling white in celebration of the new apartment I just snagged around the corner. Decided for one of their sausages for lunch and asked the bartender to pair a beer with it. He recommended one of their IPAs with a slight bitter note to cut the fat of the rabbit currywurst I enjoyed.The currywurst was juicy and cooked to perfection. Served with a tangy catsup that was a combination of curries and bar-b-que sauce with slight bitter notes that sang through the sweetness. The artisanal IPA they brewed complimented the sausage and fries with suave efficacy. The spiciness of the currywurst didn't overpower the delicateness of the rabbit of which it was composed. Dinner service features a little bit different menu targeting the slightly sophisticated palette while maintaining the corner pub feel.The waitstaff were helpful and know their beer selection well. The recommendation of the IPA was spot on, and, having tried several of their selection, could not have been paired more effectively. Definitely returning... particulrly since I will be living one block away.\",\n",

Our work schedules happened \\xa0to have worked out such that our Mondays were our Sundays.As for the food. My friend ordered the cheese and beet burger with fries. I ordered the banger, which was a sausage dish with mashed potatoes and garlic chips. And, they had blue bottle...omg..when I have the opportunity, I always indulge in blue bottle.My dish was great. The meat was tender and slightly infused with lemon. I didn't try my friend's burger but I had the fries. I didn't really want fries but omg I kept taking them to dip in the garlic aioli, the highlight of my day. I know, why is this girl raving about the aioli, of all things? The experience was great: the company, the well-made food, the coffee, oh, and the very local experience: smelling weed before I even had the chance to sit down. The only ehh factor was the pricing. Two plates, 2 coffees, $40--that's a pretty damn expensive lunch.I would certainly come back. I do want to try other dishes and maybe a beer (not too soon though because my wallet will drain faster than I earn.)\",\n",

With that being said, on a Saturday morning with a group of 8 people, you better bet we had to wait. They originally told us 40-50minute wait, which was fine since we could just hang out at the apartment during that time. After maybe 20 minutes, the hostess came up to us and told us that if we didn't mind splitting the group, we could be seated at the bar and the long table behind the bar (so essentially we'd have a walkway in between us) we were starving so we were totally fine with it. The staff was very attentive despite the whole place being packed and noisy. They checked with us frequently, and even let us order on behalf of our friends who had yet to arrive. As it got more packed in there, that's when we were questioning our decision to split our group this way since there were just so many people going through that path between our groups. I had the quinoa hash and my boyfriend had the hangtown fry. I loved the quinoa hash, it was very flavorful and the vegetables were cooked perfectly. I've never had nutritional yeast before, but it did give the quinoa a different texture and taste which was great! The oysters in the hangtown fry were phenomenal! Yum yum yum. I didn't want to have a beer early in the morning, but Magnolia, I'll be back for some of your brews and definitely again to try more delicious food.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Walking the word-famous Haight and this classic location that has been here since the '60s (and formerly known then as the Drogstore Cafe) comes to mind. While certainly known for their own micro-brews, I passed this time and had to try their 1/2 lb Prather Ranch Hamburger (ordered medium rare) and a mescaline greens salad in lieu of their fries.My wife ordered their very different bread pudding that consists of Challah bread with cheese topped with mescaline greens and two poached eggs.While the service was friendly and accommodating, the food took about 20 minutes to come out. But when it did it was excellent. My burger was a perfectly done medium-rare and was a delicious burger that could be one of the best since my Burger Joint burger at SFO (bit.ly/aQOOHY). The fresh egg bun burger was served with two condiments (a garlic dressing & ketchup) served on the side with two Dill pickle spears. The mescaline greens were perfect and fresh.The Challah Bread pudding was a lasagna-sized golden brown crusted rectangle of Challah and cheese, covered with greens and thankfully not sweet, as you would expect. The poached eggs looked odd on top of this, but when liberated to run their yolky goodness over the bread pudding, this turned into a surprisingly good entree. \\xa0Very impressed for a very pleasant location and excellent food.\",\n",

Really, all of it. Everyone at our table was thoroughly impressed by our respective entrees. Pretty much what you'd expect at such an institution: fresh, quality ingredients, assembled in well thought-out dishes. Everything just worked.As a continually evolving beer snob, I wasn't terribly impressed with the beer. But it seems that I rarely am these days when it comes to brew-pubs/restaurants like this. My beer-bar (no pun intended) has been set extremely high by craft breweries that pack focus solely on beer. So I won't hold that against Magnolia, because at least they're making the effort.Parking sucks as you might expect, but it's not as bad as some neighborhoods. Also, the biggest negative of this place is that it is ridiculously LOUD inside. Dinner conversations were a bit of a struggle with all the noise.\",\n",

I went here with a friend on a Saturday morning for brunch before heading into golden gate park.. I want to start of by saying the employees here are VERY nice and VERY courteous! They are the perfect examplification of what dining customer service should entail. The sweetest girl with the most stunningly beautiful blue eyes seated us and we proceeded with our equally as friendly waiter. He was very helpful with mine and my friends ordering and I went with a traditional breakfast plate of eggs, bacon, and potatoes and for my drink order I really wanted iced coffee and even though they do not serve iced coffee he offered to make it manually for me which was awesome! The food came and as I took a few bites of the potatoes and bacon I wasn't feeling it at all, it was too many unfamiliar flavors to me and it just didn't go well for me, my friend really enjoyed her breakfast plate so I'm sure it's definitely more of my palette issue than it is the restaurants issue.. Our waiter had noticed I had barely touched my food so he offered to replace it and I went for a burger which ended up being pretty good but nothing brag worthy... The restaurants staff and ambiance however, DEFINITELY brag worthy!\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I haven't spent a lot of time in the Haight, but friends of mine were visiting and wanted a brewery that was open for late night dinner, so we came here. There was plenty of seating (even on a Saturday night), and our drinks came out really quickly. I loved the pomegranate cider, and our other selections (Rosebud, Blue Belle, and Proving Ground) were great as well.It did take awhile for us to flag someone down to order, but after we did our food came out really quickly. Both of the cheeses we got (Echo Mountain and Fat Bottom Girl) were fabulous, as were the sardines, the warm olives, and the ravioli. We even asked for extra bread just to sop up all the ravioli sauce, it was pretty incredible. However, I thought that even though it had a lot of great components, the heirloom tomato salad paled in comparison to most of the heirloom tomato dishes I've had around the Bay Area this summer (Town Hall, Park Tavern, and Corners Tavern are just some examples that did it better) and would probably skip it next time. Still, you absolutely cannot skip out on dessert here. The chocolate bourbon pot de creme and English sticky toffee pudding were bonafide foodgasms that left us rattled in the best way possible. It was definitely not the cheapest night out ($40/person after tax and tip), but I felt that it was money well spent.\",\n",

It's metered street parking closest to the restaurant. A couple blocks down street parking is available but not metered. We arrived at 2:30.It's a very small place. I think we were lucky to get a table. It was packed. They have a large selection of beer. They offer still and sparkling water which we thought was fun (IDK why, we just did). Their menu is short, which I appreciate. They have great appetizer options followed by good starters like fresh oysters, soup of the day, and salad choices. They have a selection of sausages such as longonisa, corn dogs, and bangers. They have pub burgers, of course. Top it all off with fried doughnuts!We started off with the spicy chicken wings with a lime-mayonnaise dipping sauce. The wing sauce was tangy. They were topped with finely sliced peppers that were flaming hot. It caught me by surprise but it was an oh so good burn. I ordered the Filipino Longonisa with Bacon Fried Rice. I shouldn't have, but I ate every last bite. It tasted INSANE! The longonisa had great flavor but I ended up using this dijon mustard that seemed to be infused with horseradish, hot HOT horseradish to dip. My husband had the fish and chips, made with flounder. It is loud and perfect for groups. It's not the place for intimate conversation. It's casual and fun. We were promptly greeted when we walked in and our servers were friendly and attentive ~ all smiles. Two enthusiastic thumbs up!\",\n",

       "  'review': \"With so many different bars and restaurants in the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood, it seems to me that there are only really a handful that I'd ever consider droppin' loot on. Maybe I've had bad luck, but it seems like an overwhelming majority of these joints are trying to make a quick tourist buck. Instead of listing every restaurant that I currently approve of in the area, I'll just let you know that I think Magnolia is doing things right.Owned by the same crew that runs the Alembic, they've been able to capture a similar neighborhood following as their brethren about three blocks to the west. Albeit completely different styles, they've obviously got their hands on the secret sauce for captivating a community.Magnolia is a great neighborhood pub serving up comfort food and good beer. Some of those hoppy creations are brewed on-site, while others derive from a variety of different Bay Area microbreweries. On the food tip, the do most of the bar bites you'd come to expect, and they do a pretty great brunch. Nothing is bottomless, but they do have chicken and waffles! The best part about their chicken is that it's boneless. You can almost pick up your waffles to create a fried chicken sandwich without having to compete with those pesky bones. They have a pretty cool patio area outside also, so on a nice day like the ones we've experienced recently during our late summer, it's a beautiful way to spend a lazy Sunday.\",\n",

The beer in question was their stout, great flavors but diacetyl was too far above the threshold level. Pale ale was very good, squeky clean although I get tired of places that do not have a good water filtration system, the glass itself stank, probably from the rinse water that had dried on it. Food is of the organic and healthy type, very good in general, needs more seasoning. This type of food does not need to be bland. Unfortunately on this last visit the restaurant smelled like a urinal. Just like the dark wet corners of a subway or ally in New York City. Wow, very unacceptable, enjoy!!!

       "  'review': \"On my family's recent trip to the Bay Area, I did some research on restaurants in San Fran online and insisted that we visit Magnolia. And after the awesome experience we had there, I'm thankful we did.I love a place that brews their own beer and Magnolia ranks up there with the best I've had in the category of Pub/Brewery. We got there for dinner and it was pretty crowded, but the wait seemed to fly by after going to the bar and sipping on a beer over some good conversation.Their beers are awesome too! I had the Proving Ground IPA and the Porter. Very good flavors and paired with the food well.We started with the fried pigs ears (sounds gross I know, but ended up being like thin, crispy, bacon onion rings. Give 'em a shot). My main course stole the show though.Beef brisket braised in coffee, with a side of browned potatoes and brussels sprouts. The brisket fell apart on my fork and melted in my mouth. The sides were a perfect compliment to the beef, and washing the whole thing down with a house beer was simply delectable. I thought the whole dining experience was great. There was a wait to be seated and the food took a little longer than usual, but our host was very apologetic and took the price of the appetizer off our bill, even offering to pay for dessert as well (we would have accepted if not for being so stuffed from dinner!)All in all, Magnolia was the culinary highlight of my trip to San Francisco. Yes, for dinner it is crowded and there will be a wait, but that's what good beer is for right? Just relax at the bar and sip one until your table is ready. In the end you won't regret it.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Disclaimer, I only came for the beer. Whilst wandering the Haight with my daughter and her new friend, I realized I could send them off for some teenage alone time and get my beer fix at the same time.Was a little confused how to score a table when I walked in (no clearly marked place to put your name on a wait list) I flagged down an employee who informed me I could wait for a table but since I was there to mainly drink beer, I was welcome to find a seat at the community table. Nice long table up above the others with a clear view of the beer board. I asked a nice young lady if I could use the stool she was using to store her purse (I pointed out the under the table hooks that I have to come to realize are most ubiqitous at bars) and she gladly gave up her seat. I wasn't sure how service worked at the community table, waiter or go the bar to get a drink so I hunted down a menu myself and contemplated the beer options. Not long into my musings a waitress stopped by to see if she could help. I inquired if they have a sampler set and she informed me they did. 6 samples off some combination of the beers on tap (5 from one side of the menu and 1 from the other) for I think it was $12 or a little more to make up a sampler of my choosing. I choose standard option and scored in order of IBUs:Kalifornia KolschSarah's Ruby MildBell Blue BitterStout of CircumstanceIn with the new IPAProving Ground IPA I also ordered some fried squash blossoms as a snack.Great presentation of the sampler, served in pretty large glasses for a sample and racked billard ball style in a triangle holder. They give you a card with your beers and a place for notes. Very nice. Some of the regulars around me seemed surprised by this option for tasting so I am not sure how well advertised it is. My favorites were the Koslch, Stout and Proving Ground IPA. Good solid beers. They squash blossoms were a nice contrast for the beer and a delicious snack. Many people around me seemed to being enjoying burgers so I might need to try one next time. I also noticed people in the bar being served a half glass of beer which is another nice way to try more options. I wanted to order a glass of water and it took me awhile to realize there were shared bottles on the comminunity table and it took some work to them passed around. But mostly friendly locals at the community table.The ambiance is like a french bistro. Nice tables outside to enjoy the very uncharacteristically warm and sunny SF day. Very friendly service. I would come back some day for a proper meal.\",\n",

I reckon they have those recipes and brewing procedures down so well, they don't screw them up.Some of their seasonal real ales don't always come off, which I am guessing is because they aren't brewing them on a regular basis or they are trying to put a square peg into a round hole. Some types of beer just shouldn't be cask conditioned.When in the neighbourhood, it is a must to stop by for at least one pint. Prices are decent and the bar staff have always been pleasant or better. The one problem pointed out by many, is this place is almost always teeming, so that leisurely Saturday afternoon pint doesn't quite come off.Bottom line: if you like beer you must visit.We have eaten there as well, but will leave food reviews to the foodie folk.\",\n",

The service was very good, though we were told they have a policy where they can't seat you until your entire party is present, so grabbing a table if your friends are running late is strangely hard.

I got pork belly over home fries (don't get excited they don't have it anymore) and good god I went somewhere. In fact, that pork belly took me about a thousand miles past the acclaimed pork belly sandwich at Bar Tartine. It was fantastic. Why in gods name did they get rid of it? Fortunately, they didn't get rid of the burger. God was the burger good. No really, YUM. It had blue cheese on it, and I just could not stop eating it even though it was my date at the time's food. Oi Vey, mama mia!Later I went back to Magnolia and had a long lasting brunch with my friend from Seattle. I say longlsting because we did not stop ordering food. We had miyagi oysters, bacon wrapped figs stuffed with blue cheese, and poached eggs with asparagus. That was just some of it. There was something so simple about everything, but so damn good. My friend was surprised that she hadn't heard of Magnolia while she had lived in the bay area. I told her that I had just rediscovered it myself, and that I was planning on coming back for more. And more. And more. And...yes...more.\",\n",

Great vibe, very local feel to it, always a good selection of beers and choice of cask or draught. Nice selection of IPAs, bitters, and lighter beers for beer weenies such as myself. The Kolsch that comes in a tiny class is really perfect when you just want something light and easy. And the food is great! The fries are amazing and I recently tried one of their spicy sausages. IT WAS DELICIOUS. I love everything on their menu.Only things to be aware of: one, at evening time they often will not let you sit down without a commitment to multiple entrees from the group (as in, not a few apps to share - more expensive plates). I've been turned down for a table more than once even when the restaurant was fairly open.Two, not a great date place if you're just grabbing a drink. This place gets LOUD! And it's loud in a good way - lots of fun, relaxed, happy people grabbing a pint and catching up. But it can be quite noisy.Great place to have on my corner and I like supporting these guys. Read the history of the brewpub when you're there if you get a chance, and you'll like it even more.\",\n",

If they don't have a beer you like here you don't like beer. \\xa0The outdoor seating was nice, and they actively chase away the typical Upper Haight beggars. \\xa0Service is still a little slow, but this really isn't the kind of place that you'd want to go to for a quick bite anyway. \\xa0This is the kind of place you go to leisurely enjoy plenty of pints with good friends and some great food to match. \\xa0I don't often come to the touristy neighborhood that is the Upper Haight, but I'll make a point of braving the tourists and bums to come here more often.\",\n",

There were soooo many yummy looking beers to choose from and I started out with the Cole Porter. Very tasty, although the Stout of Circumstance ended up being my favorite. Also tried the Big Cypress Brown, but it wasn't as flavorful as the other two. No I did not have a pint of each....they have sampler sizes which are perfect if you don't want to get slosshed over lunch. Speaking of lunch, we ordered the scottish quail eggs for an app and the pork tenderloin sandwich w/beach fries. We split the sandwich and it came on 2 plates with enough fries for the 2 of us. I thought that was really nice of the waitress to do without us even asking.We sat in the corner next to the bathroom...which would usually be a problem, but it was a great view of the street and I didn't even notice the restroom traffic.Great beer, food, and service! This is a must stop from now on!\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Magnolia is my second favorite place to eat in SF. The menu is short yet inventive and inviting. They're frequently changing their offering, keeping regulars on their toes. Obviously the beers are ridiculously good, as they're brewed in-house by geniuses. Each one has a great personality, like each of the many Phish and Grateful Dead songs that permeate the atmosphere, as well as make subtle appearances in the menu stock.Every time they have a risotto on the menu I get it and I'm never dissatisfied. The majority of chefs in San Francisco suck at making risotto by comparison. The chips with the dip that is just plain old mayo and old bay are perfect.Magnolia doesn't get 5 stars because tourists eat there at all times of the day and make getting a table a real drag. As a local, I avoid going there at peak hours or when I know that some family from Ohio will be squawking a table away while I try to nurse my hangover. They just need one more waiter/waitress per shift and the place would run a lot more smoothly. Oh and the bathrooms are great. Can't argue with individual hand-towels.\",\n",

I was expecting some regular pub food but am surprised to find the food here is very solid with a great variety from small dishes to full entrees.For appetizers, get the Devils on Horseback. You can never go wrong with goat cheese-filled dates wrapped in bacon. They also have a good selection of cheese, sausages and cured meats.For entrees, my top two favorites are pork chop with mashed sweet potato and seared chicken breast with cheese tortellini. The meat is cooked to perfection and very tender. Go for the pork chop if you are in a hungry mode. The special of the day - Pappardelle with lamb ragu - was amazing as well.If you are a big beer drinker, you will be happy with the beer choices here.',\n",

Magnolia's menu doesn't even have a ploughman's plate. That said, there are some fantastic cheeses always available for a snack.Like its sister bar, The Alembic, Magnolia often carries a fantastic scrumpy cider, Sonoma Cider on draught, which is served still (no carbonation) and near room temperature. This is the first real cider (going by CAMRA rules) I've found served at a SF bar. This is brewed by Carl Sutton of Sutton Cellars in small batches, so they do run out between batches. Ring ahead if you're going for the cider, as their only other one is the cloyingly sweet Two Rivers pomegranate -- about as far from real cider as you can get. If they're out of it, The Alembic might still have it on.Unfortunately, it's a deafeningly loud pub, so if you can get a table on the sidewalk; it's worth the quiet in any weather.Has free wifi.\",\n",

Both excellent choices (and the price certainly made it a sweeter deal). The food was just OK, though. It wasn't very vegetarian friendly so my boyfriend was stuck with a few ravioli to eat, and I had the chicken, which was just alright.

       "  'review': 'On a whim, we decided that a trip to Haight-Ashbury seemed within reach of our Sacramento business trip. All the rest is circumstance, or outrageous good fortune...We hit the road in time to arrive in SF just after the height of rush hour and, after a brief driving tour decided to head to Haight Street to indulge our nostalgia for this historic place. Bad timing and planning worked against us: mist began rolling in, the temperature dropped, and we found our short-sleeved, short-panted, flip flop-wearing selves with knees knocking and teeth chattering. It was getting ridiculous: we needed to find shelter. And so we found ourselves, unexpectedly, ducking into Magnolia.Someone might argue that is the nature of this free-spirited place to cast out its loving embrace to two wayward travelers, but I\\'m good with just dumb luck. Magnolia is cozy and pub-like with lovely dark wood, \\xa0vintage tiling, and water closet-styled restrooms. The menu was equally pub-ish with a slant toward dishes that utilized the results of the micro-brewery and a northern California flare. I opened with an appetizer of home made pickles which consisted of an interesting and tasty variety of beans, peas, and other veggies suitable for brining/pickling. For an entreé, I opted for a basic, but very well prepared, platter of fish and chips and a glass of the locally brewed root beer (there was a drive back to Sacramento to consider, after all).If you find yourself at the \"Heart of the Summer of Love\" and need an escape and a good meal, Magnolia is waiting for you.',\n",

The hostess was friendly enough but she said we could not sit at a table unless we ordered lunch. When we tried to explain to her that we were planning on drinking plenty, eating appetizers, and were waiting to see the menu to decide on lunch she told us we had to sit at the bar and walked away. This makes no sense to me. There were no seats available at the bar and my friend is pregnant and her belly wouldn't fit so well in a bar stool even if we got seats. We couldn't help but notice there were more than eight completely open tables and booths. When we tracked down the host again we were refused to be seated in any of the open tables despite the rest of the restaurant being empty with no apparent line of hopeful diners.I have worked at too many restaurants and never have we ever turned a customer away. A good business model is if you have an open seat you fill it and do your best to make sure your customers walk away with a good experience. Based on the reviews of the food here and their approach to customer service my friends and I are lucky we walked away.\",\n",

They have a good selection of beer, particularly the darker brews. My friend and I were seated quickly on a Saturday evening but we had to flag down a server. I recommend ordering a flight of beer - you get to sample 6 different brews for $10 and the pours are generous compared to a few other breweries I\\'ve been to (ahem, I\\'m talking to you 21st Amendment.) The Brick Chicken was juicy and flavorful but unevenly seasoned and salty for $22. My friend\\'s burger was slightly overcooked. The English Toffee dessert ($8) was sweet and rich - a diabetic\\'s nightmare. Forget taking vegans or vegetarians here, unless it\\'s a liquid dinner, namely beer. If you\\'re just here for the beer, consider going to Alembic which is the sister pub to Magnolia, and less crowded.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Went in for a late lunch (@3:30 on a Thursday), very light crowd - mostly touristy couples. Ordered a very flavor-able stout, and the Magnolia Burger (medium) with fries. The beer was excellent, as I watched the dregs of Haight pass by - though I felt kind of guilty that I had in-front of me an $8.00 beer. The burger came after an appropriate amt. of time, with a side of mayo, whole-grain mustard and ketchup. I\\'d say the burger tasted very fresh, but had quite a bit of grizzle in it, and was served more like a meduim rare, rather than I how had ordered (no big deal). Eating it, however flavorful it was - was a challenge, as it was hand -formed, but not flattened - it was a lump of burger meat - obviously made with no care, or thought going into the process at all. \\xa0In the end, there was so much juicy stuff (tomato, and lettuce with some kind of sauce) that the bun fell apart as I tried to eat it all. The fries, looked like the broken pieces of left over fries - probably not fresh as they were more than crispy, and shattered when I tried to spear them with my fork. Bottom line - WAY over priced for the \"quality\" of food that was served to my table. Really - $26.00 for a burger, fries and ONE beer? Sorry - \\xa0I\\'d expect a much better view for that.',\n",

       "  'review': 'If Haight is the Telegraph of San Francisco, then Magnolia is the slightly grown-up version of Raleigh\\'s. My sister and I were finishing up an afternoon of shopping and were famished. I had been very curious about Magnolia since it\\'s ALWAYS packed when I walk by, so we decided to take a look inside. Magnolia\\'s outside appearance is definitely deceiving; I expected it to be similar in feel to Squat & Gobble down the street. Instead, I found myself faced with a very cute pub with high leather booths, tables, and happy people all around.There was a bit of a line, so we placed our names on the list. (I love that the list is written on a chalkboard near the door.) We didn\\'t have to wait long and were seated along the back wall close to the kitchen where all the action was at! Okay, so I am a sucker for well designed menus and consistent branding. Major props to Magnolia for menus that match the mirrors, coasters that match the paper on the menus, and amazing graphic design in general (see photos for details). I knew that unless the food was sorely lacking, this place was about to win my heart.We ordered the beer-battered onions to start. The flavors were good (would have been more awesome with beer, but my sister is underage so I refrained), but it was difficult to eat. The onions were left as bouquets of a sort instead of easy-to-eat rings and were hard to cut through. Not a huge deal, but worthy of note.For our entrees, I had the fish and chips and she had the burger. The fries are really good and came with a heaping, ultra-dippable saucer of ketchup. The fish was also pretty tasty. All around good dish. The burger came with freshly-grated mustard; I don\\'t even like mustard and I kept dipping my fries into it. We had a lot of fried food that night but didn\\'t feel gross and greasy afterwards--good sign.The portions are big, so we were pretty stuffed after all that food. Still, we couldn\\'t resist getting a dessert. We ordered the Magnolia Beer Sundae, which includes Bi-Rite \"the other one\" ice cream (very creamy with lovely hints of beer), toffee bits (amazing), whipped cream, caramel sauce, AND a chocolate chip cookie. It was really really good.Still haven\\'t tried the beer, but my hunch is that this is definitely more of a place to drink with friends than one to have a dry dinner at. Still, our meal was very enjoyable and I\\'d go back for sure.',\n",

       "  'review': \"If you like the Haight...then maybe you'll like this place. I managed to sneak in here after the rush (always helps to eat off hours). Got a table without too much of a wait (and boy can it get crowded). It's a pub for sure, with a variety of characters. Service was decent. The food was all right but nothing too remarkable. I tried the Hawaiian albacore sandwich. Some how when they split the sandwich half of it did not get the olve tapenade or sliced cucumber and was actually quite bland. The other half was far taster with the condiments. The portion size was generous. The chocolate bourbon pot de creme...(well you had me at bourbon) was quite disappointing. The texture was not creamy or whipped. It wasn't very chocolatey and it looked like it was made in someone's home kitchen (but not in the artisan way). Certainly didn't get the same batch as the other Yelpers did, because this was a fail. I'll have to get there earlier and try the brunch menu.The beers... well then, that's really what you come for. With a hearty portion of 20 ounces, you can't go wrong. They've got a great selection and the cole porter was delicious.A very dark brown, appearance. Nice coffee and some bitter dark chocolate aromas. Tasted mildly bitter but smooth finish. Mouthful of robust flavor. For drinkability I'd say this a smoother porter for the bitter profile and quite enjoyable.PS. Bathrooms in the restaurant were a little sketch. Smelled like the streets in the tenderloin and you have to be aggressive about getting the next available stall (people tend to cut in to whatever's open first)- they're both unisex, so none is cleaner then the other.\",\n",

I loved the decor, but it must be kept in mind that I was undoubtedly still walking on sunshine at the simple fact of being on Haight/in San Francisco at all!I wish I remembered what beers we had- but one turned into about six, and six craft brews is no joke. Each beer was super good, and waiter/beerlord Patrick was incredibly knowledgeable and articulate- irreplaceable when it came to the beer-choosin' time. I'm somewhat partial because of just how damn good of a time we had at this place- I was with wonderful people within in hour we were shooting the shit with the whole table of elderly gentlemen beside us. Being as I frequent bars anywhere and everywhere and that was the first time I have ever looked around to see each one of my 20-something year old friends talking and laughing with fellows who have undoubtedly been on AARP's mailing list for the past decade and a half, I think it is important that Magnolia provided that platform. Many places do not have the chops to appeal to a slew of demographics, but with its old-school feel and honest straight-out-of-their-basement brewing, Magnolia certainly does.\",\n",

Wanted to walk around Haight & Ashbury, so we tried to find some gastropubs/restaurants in the area. Decided on this place after reading reviews on Yelp; reviews about the brewery history sounded appealing. Kind of surprised, it was a pretty quiet night for Mardi Gras! Decent night for a weekday, but still not too busy in the bar area; was able to find a seat easily. Service was friendly and helpful with helping us choose some good drinks. It's STRONG BEER week/month(?), so make sure to try drinks from that menu. *****Our recommendation, and barmen's as well: Delilah Jones Rye \\xa0Appearance: clean, with decent seating areas for bar and dining.Location: right on Haight, along with other pubs; right next to a handful of bus stops! HUGE PLUS for not having to drive or deal with parking!Definitely want to come back to try the oyster beers with oysters!\",\n",

Couldn't find a seat/spot to stand at the bar, so we just tried to stand where we weren't in anyone's way (impossible). The place was so packed I kept getting jostled and so noisy we were actually yelling just to maintain a conversation.The pomegranate cider was amazing, but that was the only redeeming quality about this place. We ordered the pickles to start, they never appeared and we had to remind our waitress after we received our meals. She had completely forgotten. The fish & chips were blah, I was disappointed. The portion of tartar sauce was also really small, and I ran out and wanted to get more after one of my 2 fish sticks, but we didn't see our waitress again until the end of the meal. My friend got the sausage, she said it was pretty good but that the rice/polenta/unknown grain it came on was not that good. It got much quieter around 9:30 so I think this would be a good place to come grab a drink during non-peak dinner hours. Otherwise, totally skippable.\",\n",

Maybe he was having a bad day, I don't know. We ordered our drinks and basically snatched our menus up and walked away.

It had a certain kick to it. I did not personally taste the quinoa, but my friend gobbled it up. I'm guessing that's a good thing.Service - I hope it was just OUR waiter who was a prick and not all of them, but here's my review of that one guy. My friend asked for a sample of a beer and she got a whole one. You could just say you don't do samples. They opened the door at around 12 and we asked to move as it was extremely chilly where we were sitting (by the way, we had just ordered water at this point). He offered to close the door, closing it halfway, when we said it was still cold. He, then closed the door, but not until after complaining that it was just too stuffy with the door being closed. Or you could have just moved us as we requested in the first place, dude. I may or may not be coming here again, but I probably wouldn't be the person to recommend it. I think the food is just too overpriced for the quality. I think it has potential though...\",\n",

Def not worth the $22. The bf's burger was cooked medium rare but it had the consistency of really undercooked meat. Not the kind that is oozing blood, but if you've ever made homemade burger patties by mashing ground beef together, you know the consistency. It broke apart in my mouth like raw mashed together meat. It wasn't very bloody at all. Just pink and raw. No juice to it whatsoever. The service was so-so. It took a while for our food to come out of the kitchen. They were really busy, but I noticed almost none of the tables around ours had food on their table either. I'd say skip the food and just go for the beer, but their bar area was pretty packed the whole night and we had to play human tetris every few minutes.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'First time to Magnolia this past Sunday and I\\'m still relishing in my experience.We walked in around 2pm, and it was pleasantly busy... which showed us that we had made a good choice. \\xa0We were told that the wait for a table was 15 mins (not bad at all) but we chose to sit at the communal table where there were a handful of open stools.I made an immediate trip to the little girl\\'s room and was pleasantly surprised... very clean & well stocked restroom, awesome subway tile, fun trough-style sink, and a stocked shelf of clean hand towels. \\xa0I like this place\\'s style already.I returned to the high-top communal table to find my brother talking to Sal, our server. \\xa0Now, I got an instant good vibe from Sal. \\xa0He was very laid-back and unpretentious, dressed in a casual v-neck and jeans. \\xa0I like that there was no apparent dress code for employees... they\\'re comfortable, we\\'re comfortable. \\xa0Sal instantly impressed me as he was super knowledgeable about the menu and brews, as well as incredibly attentive to our dining needs. \\xa0He answered our numerous questions about the menu, gave great recommendations, and provided impeccable service throughout our meal.My brother and his girlfriend both ordered brews from the large chalkboard drink menu. \\xa0Sal even brought over a sample glass of another brew that he recommended. \\xa0Not ever being a beer drinker, I veered towards a Sunday brunch staple--a mimosa! \\xa0It came in a regular wine glass, was slightly pulpy (perhaps freshly squeezed orange juice?!) and was champagne heavy. \\xa0Love. \\xa0The others seemed pretty happy with their brews, although my critique wouldn\\'t be fair since I think beer tastes like soap. \\xa0Heh.Although the brunch menu was being offered, which was full of amazingly exotic sounding dishes, we all steered more towards standard lunch items. \\xa0I ordered the pub burger--because, let\\'s be honest, you can tell a lot about a place by their burgers. \\xa0It was, hands down, THE best burger I\\'ve ever had. \\xa0Although, ringing in at $14, it might have to be a \"special occasion\" burger. \\xa0And the fries, even thought they\\'re such a minor detail, were crispy and salty and delish. \\xa0We pretty much ate in silence, with the exception of the occasional \"Mmmm...\", \"Wow...\", and \"Oh my god...\" \\xa0Yes, it was THAT good.A few other noteworthy items... The music was on point! \\xa0I mean, who doesn\\'t want their brunch soundtrack filled with the likes of Bruce Hornsby\\'s Mandolin Rain, Phil Collins\\' In the Air Tonight, etc. \\xa0Reminiscent of Mike Tyson in the Hangover... \"This is my favorite part coming up right now...\" {insert amazing air drum solo} Yeah, that happened, in between bites of pub burger. \\xa0It was pretty amazing. \\xa0Also, each table is given water glasses and an old label-less wine bottle full of water. \\xa0It was another unique touch that I noticed and appreciated.All in all, it was an exceptional dining experience. \\xa0I\\'ll be honest, I don\\'t love the Haight... personal preference I guess. \\xa0But I will definitely make a trip back to the neighborhood to visit Magnolia.',\n",

       "  'review': \"Listen, you know you're in trouble as a brewery if - when asked about their favorite beers on the menu - the staff recommends three that are guest brewers. Just saying. Beer - I can't review food since we didn't have any (we tried to get a menu, but didn't, and finally gave up...). I did try a bunch of beers though, including four from Magnolia and two or three guests. The Magnolia beers were all... mediocre at best? It's a shame, I really wanted them to be awesome. Especially since they offered some on cask! But sadly, totally disappointing.Service/Atmosphere - It's a great space, honestly. The service, however, was less than stellar. After waiting near the door for a while, we finally asked someone who looked like they may work there if it was just open seating at the community high-top near the bar. She kind of shrugged, grunted something to the effect of sure, and walked away. Cool. We sat... and waited a while.... and then finally asked someone if we should order at the bar or if there was a server. She told us there was a server, so we waited. And waited. And waited. And waited. Someone finally came over maybe... fifteen minutes later? When we asked her a question about the beer, she told us she was going to send the bartender over. So we waited. He finally came over and was actually super friendly/helpful...! I wish I remembered his name, but he was the one redeeming quality in the whole experience.In conclusion - If you're not that thirsty, possibly already a little drunk, and have literally nowhere else to be for a while, I suppose you might want to stop in... but I wouldn't. But if you do - aim for some of the guest brews...\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I did not set out to visit the Haight on a recent jaunt into SF - my plan was to see the Balenciaga exhibit at the de Young - which was terrific, and then move onto a restaurant I have been wanting to try in the Western Addition. But that restaurant was booked and I veered off course a bit.When I came to the SF Bay Area over 20 years ago, I was very fascinated by the Haight Ashbury. Largely due to the fact that as a teen I devoured any and all information I could find about the \"summer of love\". Books, movies, music - you name it - I loved it and it made we want to move here.Shortly after I arrived, my husband and I got into riding vintage Vespas, wearing vintage clothes and sipping classic cocktails at Club Deluxe. We spent hours just roaming in and out of all the unique shops, having breakfast at the Pork Store and relaxing in Golden Gate park.Years passed, we moved out of San Francisco and setup house in the East Bay, had a couple of kids and I realized we had precious little time for roaming around any neighborhood - especially one as frenetic as the Haight.But this visit made me realize the only thing you need to turn frenetic into fascinating again is a well-curated plan or a willingness to just wing it. Either way Magnolia Pub and Brewery is well worth a visit. This is NOT your typical pub - they say that right on their menu.It is a very vibrant and warm space filled with an eclectic crowd - just as you would expect in this neighborhood. They brew their own artisan ales on site and source an incredible array of fresh, sustainable ingredients for their hardy menu items. Try the house made sausage and beach fries which are seasoned to perfection with Old Bay spices. You might want to go on $3 Tuesdays when all pints are just $3 all day and night.',\n",

I had the Arugula and grape salad fallowed my the Ahi fish wraps. the salad was really refreshing but a little bit too sweet. The grapes did however complement the arugula quit nicely. The Ahi wraps were really good. The fish was presented in more of a sashimi fashion, which I love because I love sushi. Therefore I did not mine. The atmosphere is nice and out server \\xa0was really nice as well. He knew the menu and recommended that Ahi and the salad to me since I am a pescetarian.

But, as with all good things I do want others to try them so here goes nothing...Let\\'s talk about crispy pork belly served over cheese grits with poached eggs. Like Usher says, \"Oh my, oh my, oh my God.\" I ate this two days in a row because it was that delicious. Let\\'s talk about a little dish they make called \\xa0\"Red Flannel Hash\" aka red potatoes, baby beets, braised brisket, and two eggs in a bowl. Am I speaking your language yet?

I grew up in England on an exclusive diet of good bitter. Mediocre at best with only a couple I liked (and I did try a lot including all the cask ones!). I was also expecting good old pub fare but the sausages weren't really sausages (kind of squished up patties in a sea of sauce) and the shepherds pie looked like, well..not, like shepherd's pie either. It was a pricey evening and I was thinking I should have stuck to my local and a raging hot curry after a skinful.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I want to give Magnolia a better review, but after a few visits I experienced a couple of red flags that are pretty unacceptable.For the most part, their food as pretty decent. I think it is fairly overpriced for the amount you receive, but nevertheless it is pretty good. They have some rather unusual dishes to offer. My personal favorite is their \"Devils on Horseback.\" You only get 2 for $5-$6, but I could have eaten 20 of those goat cheese-filled, bacon-wrapped figs. Seriously mouthwatering, and unlike anything I have ever tasted.And of course the beer is delicious as well, although it is also on the pricier side. Even for a brewery.But then comes the downfall of Magnolia. When I brought my mom and brother from out of town to Magnolia a couple days ago, we were instantly blown off by the waitress. We told her we came for a few beers and she completely brushed us off, telling us to go sit at the stool-seating section where there was obviously only one or two seats left, and not even near each other. I had planned on getting an appetizer anyway, but I knew then that I had to make my agenda very clear to the waitress for her to show us any interest or give us a seat at the booth we were already standing right next to. Mind you, this was only 2 pm in the afternoon. They weren\\'t particularly busy.Once the waitress decided we were worthy of her time, she gave us a seat at the booth.The fried pig ears were lackluster. The fries were tasty, except they could have gone easier on the salt and Old Bay. And as stated, the Devils on Horseback were, on the contrary, quite heavenly.My mother and brother love a good brewery, so I thought this would be the perfect place to bring them. Classy but relaxed, and a nice beer selection.And even after receiving the brush-off, it seemed like a good choice. Up until the point where the cockroach came out of its hiding space in the booth that we were seated at. Right next to my mom\\'s head.I\\'m not one to make a scene, so we simply moved everyone\\'s belongs to the opposite booth seat to ensure that we wouldn\\'t be wearing the filthy insect later on, or throughout our lunch. It managed to disappear again after a short moment, so we let it go.I was still willing to keep a positive attitude about the place despite the bad attitude from the waitress, as well as the obvious sign of pest infestation.But just as I was about to go for my second or third french fry, a nice, short, partially cooked blonde hair was a garnish on our overpriced food.Thanks, but no thanks Magnolia. I wanted to like you so much. But for the money, your faults just aren\\'t worth it to me.Go light on the salt, attitude, insects, AND the hair next time.',\n",

       "  'review': 'It is almost impossible to get a table at this for dinner on Friday or Saturday night. Every time I have tried to get a table here, this place is just way too packed and the wait way too long, and I leave head down and stomach grumbling.I was finally able to grab a table at this place right when it opened at 11am on a weekday. Not the most ideal time for people watching and schmoozing, but it would have to do.Magnolia is a delightful gastropub located on the corner of Haight and Masonic; the very epicenter of the Upper Haight neighborhood. The streets are live with transients from all over the world. There is definitely a lot of \"street culture\" on the surrounding streets. Despite that, I find Magnolia to be a very hip place to drink and dine. But I digress. My signature lunch combination is the Pub Burger and a pint of the Kalifornia Kolsch. The Pub Burger patty is made from all natural organic beefy goodness. Make sure to spend the extra couple of bucks for the avocado and bacon (applewood bacon to be exact!). The Kalifornia Kolsch is a refreshing blond that is not overly \"hoppy.\" This beer rates low on the bitterness scale and high on the drinkability scale. The flavors are well balanced and not overpowering. Overall, I enjoyed my weekday lunch here at Magnolia. I still would love to come here on a Friday or Saturday night. The liveliness of Magnolia during those nights can only matched by the liveliness of \\xa0Haight street.',\n",

I've seen people ask outrageous requests or try to sneak into tables when they're just drinking and they politely push them in the right direction. They also know their beer for sure.And while the food is very good here (we'll get to that), Magnolia is ultimately about the beer.But first let's talk about being a part of the community. Whether it's SF Beer week, Oktoberfest or any other holiday, Magnolia step up with great brews and nice little incentives. I didn't even realize it was strong beer week and was so excited to try some of their new concoctions which just blew me away. Just looking at the glass which they co-branded with 21st makes me realize how much Magnolia helps contribute to a rich SF beer culture. Oh did I mention they always have a shitload of beers on cask?OK the food. If you're a mostly-vegetarian like me maybe you won't be in love with their menu because it's definitely meat-heavy. But, that doesn't mean there are real bright spots for veggies. Right now they have a killer quinoa hash breakfast option which is pretty much just like what my sister-in-law would cook on her farm. Their pancakes always hit the spot and lunch-wise I've enjoyed their salads for sure.The only complaint I have is that the place gets crowded but come on, so many of the best places do. Just time your trip accordingly if that's not your thing.\",\n",

But there are a few spots that shine like a beacon of normalcy and cleanliness on this avenue of funk. Magnolia is an obvious favorite among the locals for it's bustling pub energy, affordable craft beers, low-key staff, and comfy digs. On any day of the week, you'll find Magnolia packed with a young nocturnal crowd of beer afficionados, lingering casually over local brews and new-American pub grub. I loved the Saison de Lily - a nice light Belgian style with an orange-herbal-spiceyness. The cider of the day, Pink Lady Apple, was sweet and strong at 6%. You can tell that the Magnolia folks are serious about beer, but even if you aren't they won't give you the brew-snob treatment. The staff are all super cool and will make you feel like you're part of the neighborhood, even if you're just passing through. $3 house beer Tuesdays are a great reason to visit on a weekly basis. Sit at the community bar/ table and make some friends, or at least overhear interesting conversations...\",\n",

I suppose if you literally want to burn and sweat of calories as you're eating your email, this is a good thing. But I digress...tropical forest conditions aside, this place is friggin' awesome!Started with the Big Cypress Brown (Cask). Beautiful deep brown color yet very light bodied with low carbonation which a fantastic malty taste...this was uber delicious.Pork belly and grits - I loved the grits. Lots of texture, buttery, and creamy. The pork belly is served nice and crisp, but the pieces I had were a bit too fatty for my liking and I'm the type who eats all the fat on a rib eye. Eating the crisp pork belly and the grits together is a match made in heaven.Chicken and biscuits - chicken has a nice, very thick crust. Biscuits were a tad dry however and found myself wanting more gravy. The star of the show was the fried potatoes...without a doubt some of the best tasting potatoes I've ever had. Will definitely be back for another brunch and a beer or two...okay...maybe three.\",\n",

It was properly cooked and pleasant with the carrots and mashed fingerlings, but you cannot serve that with a bitter sauce. I understand it is a porter sauce but it cannot be as bitter as what I had. So bitter the short ribs were not enjoyable as they should for a $24 plate. My buddy had the burger and let's just say the Cheesecake factory served a better burger for half the price.

Our party ordered 3 dishes - 2 chicken sandwiches and 1 burger. It took over 40 minutes to get the food delivered. The fried chicken sandwich had a decent banh mi style bread. The fried chicken was very small. I'd say the meat part probably filled up half of the bread and it wasn't even a big piece of bread. Most of the chicken was batter anyway. Overall food quality is crappy, service is incredibly slow (and the servers could care less). Don't waste your time and money here.\",\n",

Fried chicken Thursdays is something I've often looked forward to. They often change the sides but the fired chicken is always the same. Sometimes they even run out. I think I heard a story that a woman comes in every Thursday for the fried chicken and has been doing this for years. I would do the same if I still lived around the corner. The reason this place gets a 4 star instead of a 5 is because I don't love the beer. They switch it up often but it's rare that I like any of the beer which is disappointing.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I've been to Magnolia many times over the years - but it's never been a favorite because I'm just not a beer drinker, and frankly the menu never appealed to me. However I know they've gone through some menu changes recently, and it's close to the Red Vic, so I brought a date there last Wednesday.Everything was great: the house as packed when we got there, so we had time to have a pre-meal drink near the (also packed) bar area. Once seated, service was friendly and helpful. We had some delicious food: I had a spinach salad (though I really didn't like the cheese on top), he had the French onion soup, and we shared a trout dish and a bratwurst over dirty rice (it was uh-mazing).We had to rush because we realized we were running late for the movie - but our server was gracious, packaged our leftovers, and we hustled to the theater. We left happy and full.The problem came at the end of the movie: literally, as the credits rolled, so did my stomach; I barely made it to the bathroom before my stomach emptied itself. I spent ten minutes heaving up my guts before making my way out to my very sweet, incredibly understanding date.I went straight to bed, expecting to wake up feeling better...but I didn't. I called Magnolia and left a VM for the manager (AJ) that Thursday, telling him I suspected food poisoning, and asking him to call me back. My uneasy stomach lingered for FIVE DAYS, with no fever or unrelated symptoms.So AJ finally called me just 30 minutes ago (a full week after the VM). He said he was sorry it took him so long to get back to me; it's Strong Beer Month, and Beer Week too. He also says it takes 12 hours for food poisoning to set in**, so he doesn't think that was it - but he just wanted me to know he got my message.Wow. Thanks for letting me know, Doctor AJ. Up until that point I'd actually been impressed by the changes in the restaurant. I hoped for a modicum of sympathy, perhaps a promise to make sure all salads are triple-washed...or something. ANYthing. I live 7 blocks away and eat out all the time - but I guess not at Magnolia!**NOTE**: not what my research told me; food poisoning onset generally ranges from 1-72 hours from ingestion, depending on what type is contracted.\",\n",
